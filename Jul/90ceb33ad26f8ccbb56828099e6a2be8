Titled Zapolean Can’t Fall, the painting is based on the painting Napoleon Crossing the Alps, which features a euphoric Napoleon seated on his rearing stallion. This was painted by artist Jacques-Louis David in 1801 at the request of the King of Spain following the French Revolution. Durban artist Pascale Chandler said the title of her painting 
echoed calls for Zuma to step down and “satirically investigates the 
fractured reputation” of Zuma’s 
presidency. Zuma is seen in traditional regalia, including a leopard skin, beaded accessories and cultural weapons, with the South African flag and 
ANC logo randomly plastered on his figure, Chandler said. The painting will form part of an exhibition, In With The New, that will take place at The Gallery in 
Riebeek-Kasteel, 80km from Cape Town, from August 11. CAPE ARGUS
