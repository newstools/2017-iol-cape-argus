Metrorail trains have been vandalised and set alight, costing them millions of rand. This year a train driver was unable to work after having a brick thrown at his face just before the Du Toit station in Stellenbosch. Last year 60-year-old JD Joubert shot and killed a 26-year-old assailant, when he came under attack near Kraaifontein. The deployment of the armed guards will cost Metrorail R800 000 a month. The Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) promised to adhere to the demand of the United National Transport Union (Untu) by deploying the armed guards on the notorious central line in Cape Town to protect train drivers. Untu spokesperson Sonja Carstens said there had been armed guards who rode in the cabin on the central line.  “The only reason Prasa is implementing armed guards is because the passenger rail agency is faced with a pending court application in the Western Cape High Court,” she said. Untu has appealed to the court to order Prasa to fulfil its obligation towards its employees in terms of the Occupational Health and Safety Act, the Labour Relations Act and the constitution by forcing the state-owned-enterprise to provide a safe working environment. “If Untu does not go ahead with its application, Prasa might withdraw the armed guards.” Carstens said Prasa had neglected to invest in training and equipping security services and instead cut costs in that area to save money. “You cannot expect security guards to fight armed robbers with a baton. “They had to be trained in handling firearms. With the lack of security, came an onslaught on railway networks seen by criminals as soft targets for cable theft and armed robbery.” Metrorail spokesperson Riana Scott said the introduction of armed guards was in response to “a very specific threat”.  Prasa is offering a reward of up to 
R2 5000 for information on vandals.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
