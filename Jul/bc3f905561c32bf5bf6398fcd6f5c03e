Cape Town - The search for 7-year old Louise Fowler who was swept out to sea on Friday is continuing. “So far we have found nothing,” said Jorkia Rabie of the Neighbourhood Watch’s fire and emergency support services. Fowler was swept off the rocks at Betty's Bay while standing with her mother, Kim, when a strong current swept her away while the family was on a weekend getaway. They are from Claremont. A team of 30 volunteers are assisting in the search. “The NSRI Hermanus Sea Rescue craft South Star and Jaytee III, NSRI Hermanus shore crew, the SA Police Services, a Police Dive Unit, Overberg Fire and Rescue Services, Cape Nature Conservation officers and the Betty’s Bay Neighbourhood Watch members continued in an ongoing search operation for the 7 year old Claremont girl.”  NSRI spokesperson Craig Lambinon said. Meanwhile, Greenfield Primary School has arranged a “Thanksgiving” service in memory of the little girl tomorrow in Kenilworth. “The Greenfield community mourns the tragic passing of Louise Fowler, a Grade 1 Greenie. Our hearts and prayers go out to Kim, Ryan, Claire and their family and friends. The loss of a child is indescribable. May the loving memories they have of Louise carry them through their grief. "Louise was with us for too short a time, but what a sweetheart. Our thoughts are with her teachers and classmates at this difficult time. May she rest in peace,” the Facebook post read.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
