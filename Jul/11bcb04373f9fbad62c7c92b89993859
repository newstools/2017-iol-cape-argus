Cape Town - A young girl mauled by two dogs in June still faces a long road to recovery. Emma Murphy, 3, was attacked when two dogs, reportedly a Pitbull and a Rottweiler, were startled in their yard. It's believed the neighbours' dogs jumped the fence into the Murphys's yard and were rummaging near the dustbins. Her grandfather, Aubrey Murphy, who was with her at the time, rushed to her aid, lying on top of her to protect her from further attacks, while he himself sustained injuries. Emma's twin sister Kate could only look on in horror. The girls are undergoing play therapy to help them deal with the trauma, while Emma still has countless operations scheduled over the next 18 months. She has already gone under the knife 10 times. Emma is being treated at the Red Cross War Memorial Children's Hospital. Her grandfather was discharged from Vincent Palotti on July 14, nearly a month after the attack. In order to care for her twin girls in the wake of the attack, their mom Tracy has had to shut down her newly-opened salon indefinitely. While Kate has returned to school, Emma needs consistent care between her cosmetic procedures. A crowdfunding campaign was set up on donations-based crowdfunding platform Backabuddy, by Tracy's close friend Paula Pinkham. So far, the campaign has raised R158 472.42 towards a target of R250 000. You can donate to Emma's campaign here. Cape Argus
