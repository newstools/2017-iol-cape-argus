Cape Town - Hout Bay community members came out in numbers on Monday to protest against the lack of housing. Residents have blockaded Victoria road for a third day. A man was reportedly injured when shots were fired. Emergency Medical Services spokesperson Robert Daniels said the man is in a critical, but stable condition. "At 10.30 this morning Western Cape Government Health Emergency Medical Services were dispatched to the Hout Bay protest where an adult man suffered a gunshot wound to his chest leaving him in a critical condition," Daniels said. "Due to ongoing violence and road closures in and around Hout Bay EMS could only reach the patient at 11.00am and eventually delivered him to Victoria Hospital at midday today in a critical but stable condition." A City official tried to talk to the community but residents would not allow him. There is a strong police presence.         Community leader Markus Ndude said: "We don't want any other city official to address us we want the mayor with contractors to come here." Mayor Patricia de Lille is set to meet with community leaders.           marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
