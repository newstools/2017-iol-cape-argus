Tshwete visited the Preekstoel Project, a Biofiltration Plant in Hermanus, last week. It cost R85.1 million and was funded by the Overstrand Municipality, the Department of Water and Sanitation and the Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, with engineering and construction companies Aurecon, Inyanga Projects, PCI Africa and Umvoto Africa (Pty) Ltd. The delegation indicated that for the countryâ€™s water resources to be made more viable, they were considering strict implementation of drought operating rules at all dams, and increasing the water mix (especially groundwater utilisation, rain harvesting, re-use of return flows and packaged desalination plants).  This in addition to reducing operational risks through proper infrastructure operation and maintenance, and increasing skills development and climate and hydrological research, said Overstrand Municipality spokesperson Charmaine Resandt. The municipality had the plant built in response to urban and new business growth, and to accommodate future developments.  The plant removes high levels of iron and manganese from borehole or ground water through a unique bio-filtration system. Cape Argus
