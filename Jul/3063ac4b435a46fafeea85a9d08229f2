The girls, all from Dr Van der Ross Primary School in Belhar, participated in the regional finals recently and have qualified for the nationals. But not all the girls are able to go - five will have to sit at home because of a lack of funds. They leave for Durban Thursday. This will be the first time the squad will participate together in Durban. In 2012, Shona Davids and Abigail Magalies took part for Western Province colours in Durban. Last year the squad took part in Nationals in Germiston, and Jo-Dean Martin, their youngest leader, received gold. Over the years the squad has had 16 WP players and three received SA  Majorette and Cheerleading Association colours. The squad participated and came fourth for groups in small drill and sixth for large drill in the region. “The area we are situated in is very dangerous. When we practise on the field the gangsters run on the field with their guns. One of our coaches was held at gunpoint once,” says senior trainer and educator Morisha Prince. Deputy principal Eugen de Beer said  because the school is in a sub-economic area, the girls are encouraged to practise most days of the week, weekends and even holidays. “Regardless of gangsterism, these girls can achieve greatness,” says De Beer. Girls in the squad start as young as six. “Drum majorettes teaches us about responsibilities. We achieve things and are able to see places other than Belhar,” says large drill leader, Ashnique Paulse, who joined the squad at the age of 9. Cape Argus
