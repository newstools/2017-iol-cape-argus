According to Ulrich, he bought a  limited edition Nelson Mandela figurine from a company in the US. He then stumbled across a news article about Mandela Day that said “Want to celebrate Mandela Day? Here’s how”. “I got the idea to start this initiative and was hoping the Cape Argus can help me with my contribution to honour the legacy of Nelson Mandela,” he said. The booklet, in which Mandela’s life story unfolds in stunning toy and diorama photography with supporting text, is also packed full of fun, with a wonderful compendium of “snakes and ladders type” sports games to illustrate how he inspired many great sporting moments. The sports game comprises a rugby stadium with quotes by Mandela around the canvas. “Nelson Mandela brought together a nation through sports. The quotes will be there to educate and also bring awareness on the impact Mandela made when he was alive,” said Ulrich. “I am hoping that, with the help of possible sponsors, the book will be launched in September.” Each of the figurines in the book will symbolise a period of Mandela’s life. “An example would be about the time he spent in prison.” Local and international artists and celebrities will be invited to submit their personalised Mandela artworks for display at an exhibition.
