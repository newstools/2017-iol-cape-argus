The Cape Town squad secured the 4th position and were awarded by the South African Majorette and Cheerleading Association. Categories for groups ranged from flag groups, throwing prop and baton. The girls of Belhar succeeded proudly in the groups' section. The squad was awarded gold for non-prop pompom and for throwing prop and received silver in the sub-leader category consisting of 12 girls. The squad as a whole in the duals and flags section received bronze. “The group started fresh this year with 20 new members. The squad took in girls from grades 1 to 3, the youngest squad ever in the history of the school,” said Western Province coach Morisha Prince. On the day of departure, last minute sponsors by ward councillor Desmond Japhta and Mayor Patricia de Lille’s office made it possible for five girls who didn’t have the necessary funds to head off with the rest of the squad to the nationals. Labelled “Drummie Mummie”, Lynne Adams said the parents also assist where they can whether it be support or a simple meal for a girl whose parents aren’t able to provide them. Educator Eugene de Beer said: “Despite all the chaos little things like having the youngest member, 6-year-old Amber Kiewiets, loose her milk tooth on the tour makes it memorable for us. We are a family away from home”. Cape Argus
