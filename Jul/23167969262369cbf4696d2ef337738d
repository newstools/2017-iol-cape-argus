The “Mandela Day Makeover”  became a reality during the school holidays when  Neil Rautenbach, from Oriole Organics, teamed up with  Fair Cape Dairies and school principal Mlungusi Fani. Louis Loubser,  chief marketing officer  of Fair Cape Dairies, said they wanted to do something  “lasting and sustainable”. Fair Cape Dairies have donated 300 vegetable seedlings, ranging from spinach, cabbage and lettuce to herbs and other gardening materials. Other donors included MLT Car Hire Tours,  Stanler Farms and Wurmbosch, which  donated an apple tree. The aim of the vegetable garden was to help feed approximately 1 200 children at the school, said Rautenbach, adding: “With 50 kids helping to weed and rake the ground well, there is nothing more rewarding!” *  For more information call 071 166 9793 Cape Argus
