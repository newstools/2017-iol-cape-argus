Cape Town - Funny man Chris Forrest is back, but his repertoire has changed dramatically from local politics and the state of the country. Instead he will be sharing his rip-roaring experience as a first-time father. Forrest is inviting all parents and parents to-be to his spanking new side splitting one man show Who's Your Daddy? currently on at the Kalk Bay Theater. You can believe that Chris doesn't hold back on his new experiences after becoming a father. His best advice: “Don’t ever argue with a pregnant woman!” Chris shares valuable tips on dirty nappies, what really goes down and how to deal with the madness. “It's funky, honest and (if I do say so myself) very funny look at the journey to parenthood, it's all based on 100% true-life stories. It's my fifth one-man show, but by far and away the favorite one that I’ve written because it's so close to my heart,” Forrest said. The show is written by Forrest and directed by Bevan Cullinan. You can expect Chris’s truth to flow with his awkward sense of humour and razor-sharp wit. As a new father to two beautiful girls Forrest's experience as a father is downright honest. “As much as people tell you, it will change your life! When EVERYONE tells you that you’ll never truly understand until you experience it yourself. I’ve learnt so much about myself by looking after my two little ones. It's amazing,” he said. Who's Your Daddy? is on until August 6. Tickets cost R150 per person (Tuesday show special: buy one, get one free) and are available online. You can also book by calling 021 788 7257 or emailing kalkbaytheatre@gmail.com.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  @MarvinCharles17 Cape Argus
