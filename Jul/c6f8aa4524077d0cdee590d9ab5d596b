Cape Town - Some people choose to allow the circumstances they find themselves in to influence their lives, while others choose to use adversity to overcome their challenges.&nbsp; This is true for young Azaliah Smith, 11, a talented gymnast from one of the worst neighbourhoods in the city.&nbsp; Tafelsig, in Mitchell's Plain, has one of the highest murder rates in the country.&nbsp; Azaliah and her family live in a wendy house situated in a back yard in Tafelsig, Mitchell's Plain. They share the yard with three other families.

Only after I tried it, I realised that I like it. I enjoy the sport very much.&quot;&nbsp; Azaliah makes vetkoek. Picture: Henk Kruger/ANA Pictures She's now the lead gymnast at the&nbsp;Wasabi Gymnastics Club at Cedar High School in Rocklands. After just four years participating, she is already &quot;exceptionally talented&quot;. &quot;She has a natural talent for the acrobatic gymnastics,&quot; head coach Dirks said.&nbsp; Azaliah holds up some of the medals she's already bagged. Picture: Henk Kruger/ANA Pictures &quot;When she started doing the sport she took to it like a fish to water. And it is not an easy sport this, because you are bending your body to the extreme.&nbsp; &quot;Azaliah is already a level eight and the top gymnast in her age group. She will be part of the group who will be representing our country in Egypt. The games happens next year.&quot; Azaliah needs funds to travel to Egypt and her mom is at her wits' end trying to get her to the May 2018 competition.&nbsp; Azalia's brother Diego and their mom Bronwyn in their wendy house. Picture: Henk Kruger/ANA Pictures &quot;I encourage my children to get involved in sport. I am very proud of her. But we need to start fundraising, so that she will be able to participate in the competition in Egypt,&quot; her mom, Bronwyn, said. * If you'd like to help, you can call Riyanah Dirks on&nbsp; 076 522 7001 CAPE ARGUS
