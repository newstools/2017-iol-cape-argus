On Monday evening she met city officials and community leaders to discuss a way forward after the area was hit by violent protests at the weekend.The session went on until late in the evening, where De Lille and her team tried to reach consensus with the community leaders. I am relieved that I was finally able to address the community following prolonged violent protests which caused a very volatile situation. She also assured residents that they had a direct line of communication to her. The people of Imizamo Yethu cannot afford these kinds of setbacks. We have said from the outset that we have to work together to ensure the people receive the services they need, she said.De Lille said she would be assigning a new programme management team to facilitate and oversee all line departments in the area. Community leaders agreed with the way forward that we discussed and will keep engaging on the finer details of how the proposed steps will unfold. Hout Bay Ratepayers Association has labelled Monday s violence as disgusting . We have always wanted Imizamo Yethu to be part of the Hout Bay community, with proper homes and proper sanitation. We have always supported this, said Len Swimmer, chairperson. He also said the protest was completely unnecessary . Swimmer also said that residents of Hout Bay now had a different attitude towards Imizamo Yethu residents. When the fire broke out in March we, as residents, opened our hearts to them. But now residents now have a very different attitude. On Monday, residents of the informal settlement went on the rampage. Police used rubber bullets and stun grenade. Residents have accused the city of making empty promises&quot; about the rebuilding programme. [email&#160;protected]Cape Argus
