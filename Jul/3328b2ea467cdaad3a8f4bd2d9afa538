Thulani Zondani, who is part of the leadership of the movement and the deputy chairperson of the Khayelitsha Water and Sanitation Forum, was stabbed several times as he walked home from work. According to Andile Lili, the chairman of Ses’kona,  a group of men accosted him. Lili said a passer-by helped him. Police said they were investigating the circumstances surrounding his death. “We are very sad at this vicious killing of a real fighter,” said the Khayelitsha Development Forum chairperson, Ndithini Tyhido. Tyhido said he did not want to speculate about the motive surrounding the death of Zondani. “All I have to say is that the community is very angry and very scared,” he said. Zondani made headlines in 2013 when he, along with the movement, came into the spotlight after they threw human faeces at cars along the N2 highway, the airport and the provincial legislature. Zondani was also involved in discussions  with local government and representatives of the Department of Water and Sanitation  about challenges relating to sanitation in informal settlements. “We lost a great fighter. He was a very honest person,” Lili said. No arrests have been made. Anyone with information is requested to contact Crime Stop at 08600 10111.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
