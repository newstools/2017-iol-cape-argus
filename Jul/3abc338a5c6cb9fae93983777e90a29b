Cape Town - More than 3000 Hopefield residents are benefiting from the Hopefield Home Improvement Project. The project has made the lives of the residents more comfortable, especially during the winter. The project was launched in 2013 had has reached around 590 households. Phase 2 will see the upgrading of 351 homes over a three year period. Umoya Energy, owner and operator of Hopefield Wind Farm, is footing the bill. The upgrades include the installation of insulation, solar-powered geysers, safe electricity and carpentry. Resident Lorenda Bruintjies said: "We now have a ceiling, which we didn’t have before. The newly-installed solar geyser, which uses energy from the sun, is a blessing, especially in winter, it’s amazing." The Project has now grown to include an Enterprise Development Programme, that aims to equip the contractors with the necessary equipment, guidance, business support and mentorship, in order to develop successful businesses.  Chief community operations officer for Umoya Energy Sizile Mabaso said: "This programme was designed to develop skills of local businesses, to be sustainable to ensure enduring benefits for this community.” Cape Argus
