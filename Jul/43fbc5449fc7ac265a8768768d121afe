Cape Town - He was known as the little drummer boy and crept into the hearts of millions of South Africans for his abilities and as the youngest music graduate. Now Daniel Petersen, who used his talents to reach out to underprivileged children, has been recognised by former US president Barack Obama, receiving the prestigious Barack Obama Lifetime Achievement Award in the US over the weekend. Petersen, 14, received the award at a ceremony in New Orleans. In 2014 he became the youngest person to obtain a degree in music at the University of the Western Cape (UWC). He has been playing drums since he was 3. Petersen received the award for his commitment to community work and nation-building. He started the Daniel Petersen Foundation for underprivileged children who do not have access to musical instruments. The foundation has helped thousands of young people to get music lessons.He also assisted Nosaconn, a non-profit organisation in New Orleans, to raise funds for an after-schools music programme that helped youngsters get music lessons and access to instruments. Petersen has requested the public to donate any unused musical instruments to the Daniel Petersen lll Foundation. Speaking from New Orleans yesterday, he said: Even though Barack Obama could not make the awards ceremony, it was an honour to be recognised by his foundation. This award is also for South Africa, our new democracy and the youth of 1976 who paid with their lives. I was only 14 months old when my dad (also Daniel Petersen) came home one day and heard me playing them. From then onwards he taught me how. &quot;I will soon be leaving for Kazakhstan, to be part of the Nelson Mandela Day Celebrations. It is my dream to obtain my PhD by the age of 22.&quot;Cape Argus
