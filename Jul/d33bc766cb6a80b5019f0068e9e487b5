Sri Lanka - A country's navy is its first line of defence against marine poaching, pirating and illegal entry by sea, and while most navies in the world are used to seeing all manner of vessel, they may not be used to seeing a five-ton mammal getting into difficulty. A naval Fast Attack Craft first noticed the strange anomaly in the water - an Asian elephant being dragged out into the ocean off the coast of Kokkilai, Sri Lanka. When the navy encountered the pachyderm, it had already been dragged 8 nautical miles (14.8km) off the coast and out to sea. "The elephant dragged away by current was initially noticed by a Fast Attack Craft on routine patrol in the aforesaid sea area," the Sri Lankan navy said on its website on Tuesday. "Thereupon, another Fast Attack Craft on patrol and a team of navy divers were promptly directed to the location by the Navy. Stepping up the rescue effort, two more Cedric Boats along with seven naval personnel attached to the Rapid Action Boat Squadron were also dispatched for the 'Jumbo' rescue mission. "A group of officials from the Department of Wildlife also joined this humongous task providing necessary instruction which became extremely vital in the rescue mission. "Accordingly, they were able to carefully direct the elephant towards the coast from the deep sea, by means of ropes. Having safely guided the elephant to the Yan Oya area in Pulmodai, the animal was handed over to the Wildlife officials for onward action."
