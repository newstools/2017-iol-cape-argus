Gauteng - Local entertainer Amor Vittone, known for her singing and her high profile relationship with recently deceased rugby legend Joost van der Westhuizen stopped by Jacaranda FM on Tuesday when she spoke about her current public court battle over Joost's estate. According to previous reports, by the time of Van der Westhuizen's death they were still married in community of property, although they were separated at the time of his death. The battle comes as Van der Westhuizen allegedly made a will on 2 September 2015 without Amor’s knowledge. Previously her lawyers filed the original testament she and her estranged husband Joost van der Westhuizen drafted eight years before his death, with the help of Rudolph Pretorius from Landa Administrators at the master of the Pretoria High Court. Under this will, both she and their two children inherit everything. Since Van der Westhuizen's death in February 2017, after a long battle with motor neurone disease, there has been a battle over Joost’s estate. While speaking to the radio host's Martin Bester and Tumi Morake she addressed the many rumours circulating.   Source: Jacaranda FM Cape Argus
