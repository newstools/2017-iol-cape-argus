Azaliah will be participating in the World Age Group Competition in Belgium next year, representing South Africa. She does acrobatic gymnastics and is top in her age group at the Wasabi Gymnastics Club at Cedar High School in Rocklands. She is already a level eight and the top gymnast in her school. Azaliah stays with her mom and brother in a Wendy house in the yard of their grandmother in Tafelsig. Her coach, Riyaanah Dirks, said that among the calls she received was one from a woman who is a well-known singer in the UK. “She does not want her name to be mentioned, but she has offered to pay all Azaliah’s expenses with regards to the competition. This was followed with more calls from people who want to give her free dance training. And others are going to print T-shirts for her. “One lady even offered to make the team leotards, as one costs close to a R1000. It’s been amazing. We want to thank all these kind Samaritans from the bottom of 
our hearts.” Azaliah’s mom, Bronwyn Smith, could also not stop thanking the Cape Argus. “It was heart-warming to see how many people responded to help,” she said. “I’m a single parent raising both my children alone. I am very proud of my daughter. I know how talented she is, but I was worried where I was going to get the money so she could take part in the competition. “There are lots of children in our communities who are talented but often, due to finances, they can’t take part in sports competitions.”  rusana.philander@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
