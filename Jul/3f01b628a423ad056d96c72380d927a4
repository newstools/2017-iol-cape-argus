The mayco member for safety, security and social services, JP Smith, said the city placed a major emphasis on youth development and providing safe, quality programmes and facilities which encouraged the youth to stay active and away from anti-social behaviour. There are similar facilities in Gugulethu, Khayelitsha, Delft and Nomzamo in the Strand. Smith says a sixth smart park is under construction in Mfuleni. “Ultimately, children should be supervised within the park by a parent or guardian. The city’s enforcement agencies do general patrols as often as they are able to,” he said. “The largest factor in determining whether these spaces are safeguarded for the needs of children is the extent to which they are used and ‘owned’ by local communities. We also encourage residents to report any suspicious behaviour or vandalism to the city via our call centre or via their local ward councillor.” “The City of Cape Town has 12 district parks and 3 526 community parks, 151 sports fields, 197 community and indoor centres, 10 biodiversity areas and 72 beaches/nodal points across the metropole,” said Smith.  sibahle.skomolo@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
