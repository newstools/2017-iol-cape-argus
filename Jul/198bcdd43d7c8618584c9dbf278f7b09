After retiring from the force after 30 years, Blake started to engage with the city and councillors regarding issues that the community is grappling with. “I go to different areas, see the dirt, take pictures and write to the councillor of that area, and to the mayor, to address the issue. There is a serious issue of dumping in the poor areas and I blame the law enforcement.” He explained that dumping happens during the day when law enforcement officers are on duty, but nothing is being done. “There needs to be increased visibility of law enforcement during the day.” Blake wrote to them saying they need to form a task team to do an assessment of the dumping that is happening, and they need to be on duty at night, then necessary intervention must happen. He said councillors must install skips where people can dump. “Law enforcement needs to take action.” The council vehicles need to have signs about the consequences of dumping on the road. Blake believes that this is a good 
way to inform people, so that they stop dumping. “Using the media to inform people is important. No one is talking to the 
community.”  nickita.maesela@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
