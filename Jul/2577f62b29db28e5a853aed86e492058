Dawid Petersen, who grew up on Compagniesdrift, said: “There's a woman, whose name I don't want to reveal, who received a letter saying she needs to vacate the house she grew up in. "Both her parents worked on the farm until they retired, but now she has to find a new house. "They said she has to leave the house because she does not work on the farm, but they are  employing people who are not staying on the farm. Her father worked on the farm for many years. She has nowhere else to go. “There are currently 10 people residing in the house we're staying in. We had to vacate three houses we were staying in for many years. "The houses were revamped and there are now other people staying there. It is being hired out to people from outside. We fear they will soon also start evicting us from this house, that is why we want to move back to our original homes," said Petersen. Wilma Petersen, 58, who also grew up on the farm,  lives with her 28-year-old son in a small room. “Before we had our own house, now we are living like sardines in this house.  There are four families staying in this house. We are human beings, why must we live in these conditions?” she said. Carmen Louw, from the organisation Women on Farms, said: "If the residents worked on the farm they have a right to long-term occupancy and they must stay in the same conditions as before. They cannot be moved to an overcrowded house.” In response to a media enquiry, Albie de Waal from Meerlust, said: “We assume that you refer to people renting houses from two BEE companies, Compagniesdrift and Faure Agrivillage. "The people renting from the two companies have formal rental agreements, the execution of which resort under the management of the companies concerned and, like all rental agreements, the parties must adhere to the stipulated agreement detail. Perhaps you can enlighten us as far as the eviction rumours are concerned.”  rusana.philander@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
