The Solo Studios Linocut Project is an opportunity for Capetonian art collectors to visit artists in their studios in the Riebeek Valley to purchase their artwork. Solo Studios is a collaboration between artists, art curators and galleries in the area. Klaus Piprek, the originator of Solo Studios, said, “What we would ideally hope for, is that the art lover will support the project by acquiring a box set of limited prints (only 5 of 15 sets left for sale), or attend the Solo Studios weekend event.” The People’s Gallery was set up by Solo Studios last year as a platform for unknown and underprivileged artists to showcase and sell their work. Emma Willemse,the co-ordinator of the Linocut Project, said, “Our experience last year with The People’s Gallery showed that support is not only essential during the time of the Solo Studios event, but that the need is much wider, for instance to provide training and life-and-business skills to artists. The percentage of the income from the Linocut Project fundraising is enabling Solo Studios to develop and promote disadvantaged artists.” Solo Studios have collaborated volunteering groups such as “Sopkombuis” - an initiative to provide children in the Riebeek Valley community with meals, clothes and participation in creative activities. Last Friday, Solo Studios assisted in an event where 30 children decorated black wheelie bins with paint. This event from  August 11-13 will involve 16 renowned artists from the valley, allowing art lovers and collectors the rare opportunity to acquire their work directly. Five group exhibitions will also feature during the event, including 12 authors and six photographers. *  See www.solostudios.co.za Cape Argus
