Cape Town - Kenilworth Racing is investigating the death of a groom at Milnerton racetrack after he died while exercising one of the horses. It is believed the groom, who worked for Bass Riding Stables, died when the horse tripped and he fell off, apparently breaking his neck.
Candice Bass-Robinson, head trainer, said the incident was “unfortunate and tragic”. She only knew the groom as “November” and he had been working at the stables for less than eight months. Bass-Robinson said her brother, Mark, and assistant trainer Trevor Taylor ran to his aid. “It was very quick. By the time they got to him, he was dead within minutes.” Phumelela Racing, which owns the track, confirmed the incident. “A full investigation will be undertaken by Kenilworth Racing,” it said. An autopsy report has yet to confirm the exact cause of death. The Milnerton Racing Track currently works between 900 and 1000 horses and members of Phumelela Racing visit the track at least four times a day to check the maintenance of the track for safety purposes. “This is the first major accident that has happened at the track,” said Bass-Robinson.
