He participated in several trials held by the South African Schools Football Association this year. Hayden is one of four pupils chosen from Cyprus Primary in Athlone. His parents Basil and Carlin are excited for him to showcase his talent. “I am very overwhelmed and proud of my son. He is a natural-born star, and now is his chance to prove it!” said Carlin. Basil said Hayden has the ability to go far in football. “He has worked very hard for this opportunity and the exposure at the tournament will help him in a big way,” he said. “Here in Bridgetown, children aren’t motivated to pursue their goals. “We live in a drug-infested area with gangsterism being the epicentre. “Hayden has beaten all the odds that were against him.” Hayden has withstood the negative influences he faces every day. “I am very excited, especially because I will be going overseas. I hope to make new friends during my stay,” he said. “I also hope to improve my skills.” The Van der Horsts need R25 000 for Hayden’s trip to Thailand in November. They plan to raise funds with raffles and by selling food. *  Anyone who wants to assist may contact them on 081 805 936 or 072 037 7510. Cape Argus
