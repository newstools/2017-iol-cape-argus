Cape Town -  Victims of the Cape storm and Southern Cape fires that wrought devastation last month are set to benefit from a concert which aims to raise funds in order to help rebuild their lives. Good Hope FM has teamed up with GrandWest Casino and Entertainment World to host the United in Hope Benefit Concert, taking place on Saturday, August 5 at the GrandArena to raise funds for thee victims of the fires and storms. The benefit concert will include performances by Locnville, Tresor, Chad Saaiman, Nasty C, Dominic Neill, Lakota Silva, dance company Afrika Ablaze, New Hero, Can Skylark among many others. All the artists are giving their time and talent pro bono in support of giving hope to those in need. Good Hope FM Station Manager Brendan Ficks said: “We all feel an initial sense of helplessness when a natural disaster hits our communities and we see suffering all around us but don’t always have the means or know-how to help. Together we can make a significant contribution and most importantly, give hope to those affected. “We encourage the people of Cape Town to come out and support this initiative. Every cent raised goes towards the two organisations we have nominated to receive the proceeds - Community Chest and The South African Red Cross Society.” Good Hope FM presenters will MC the event which also includes stand-up performances by Dalin Oliver and Carl Weber as well as SA’s top ventriloquist, Conrad Koch. Tickets are R150 and are available at Computicket. For more information and an up-to-date line-up of performing artists, visit www.goodhopefm.co.za Cape Argus
