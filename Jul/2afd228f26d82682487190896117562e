Pascoe said the first point of entry, which is for victims to report crimes over the counter at police stations, often led to victims not reporting violent crimes. She was responding to a Western Cape High Court judgment in the Cameron Wilson matter where Judge 
Chantel Fortuin in her judgment referred to the fear witnesses experienced and often during her evaluation or summary of 
the witnesses’ evidence indicated how the events traumatised them. Wilson was found guilty of killing five people, including 18-year-old Valhalla Park teen Lekita Moore, who was hacked to death. She was stabbed about 98 times. Of the 15 charges against him, including five murders, two rape charges and four attempted murders, Wilson was found guilty of 13 charges and was acquitted of a rape and attempted murder charge. Advocacy groups welcomed the judgment and said they hoped it would encourage victims and witnesses to come forward. Pascoe said she was happy with the judgment, but said she was concerned at how witnesses and victims were treated. “There is no privacy for rape victims to tell their case. They have to speak over a counter to a male officer. Space should be set aside at police stations where victims can made to feel comfortable in telling their stories. “Laying a charge is the worst stage; its entry point of engagement. The judiciary should look at how victims are treated at police stations.” Director at the Saartjie Baartman Centre for Women and Children Shaheema McLeod said this case could possibly increase the public’s confidence in the justice system and more witnesses and victims would come forward to report crimes. “Witness testimonies are crucial. Sometimes these cases are heard years later and the victims and witnesses are forced to relive the trauma, some 
of which they had already blocked out of their memories.” Community Safety MEC Dan Plato said Friday’s judgment sent out the right message.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
