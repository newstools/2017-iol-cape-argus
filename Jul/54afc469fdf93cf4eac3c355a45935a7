Cape Town - The 27 000 strong City of Cape Town workforce was&nbsp;honoured by Mayor Patricia De Lille during the third annual mayoral awards ceremony held at Cape Town Stadium on Saturday. &nbsp;Law enforcement officer Jacobus Galant, from Muizenberg, received the award for Outstanding Service to the Community for stepping in to get beachgoers to safety after a fight broke out between around 50 rival gang members.&nbsp;&nbsp;On Sunday, Galant said he didn t expect to receive the award which is a big achievement and serves as more motivation .&nbsp;Galant said he was already off-duty on the Day of Goodwill and had gone for a jog when he spotted rival gangsters brawling between Surfers Corner and Sunrise Beach. &quot;Instinct kicked in.&quot; He jumped into action, ushering beachgoers to safety before approaching the gangs.&nbsp; &quot;I was a prison guard for 20 years and we were taught always to be cautious. I combined the skills I learnt at the prison and my 10 years with Law enforcement and followed procedures, step by step to stop the fight. I knew that they did not have guns because they would have used them already.&quot; &nbsp;He was nominated by his bosses not only for his heroics on the day, but for effecting even more arrests, including nabbing two would-be hijackers who tried to attack two women along the Borcherds Quarry bridge in July, 2016. The Customer Care award went to the MyCiTi Operations team who hastily put a plan in place to ferry 500 Metrorail Central Line passengers stuck at Cape Town station after 9pm, getting them all home before midnight.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cape Town, said De Lille, had a proven record of being the best run metro in the country and was the only metro to receive a clean audit for 2015/16.
