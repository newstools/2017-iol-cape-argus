San Antonio, Texas - We've all heard the saying "Put your money where your mouth is", but Trent Kimball, CEO of Texas Armoring Corporation, goes a whole lot further for this video. He sits in one of his company's vehicles, seemingly without even flinching, while one of his employees puts 12 rounds from an AK-47 straight into the windshield.   Texas Armoring prides itself on using high-tech lightweight materials to build armored vehicles that'll stop most hand-held firearms, without adding tons of extra weight, but there is still only one way to make bullet-resistant glass - multiple layers of tempered glass laminated with thin sheets of polyvinyl butyral or polyurethane, with a soft layer of glass or polycarbonate on the inside to prevent spalling - as can be seen in the video. But the outstanding feature of this demonstration has to be the testicular calibre of the demonstrator. Respect. IOL Motoring  Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
