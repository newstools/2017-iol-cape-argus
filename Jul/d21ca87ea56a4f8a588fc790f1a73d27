Grace, the world No. 35, picked up eight birdies in a flawless third round to move to 4-under-par, two shots behind leader Jordan Spieth. There have been 31 rounds of 63 in major championships and Grace’s feat prompted a standing ovation at the 18th green as he saluted the packed galleries at Royal Birkdale. “I honestly had no idea that was something historic,” Grace said. “I knew I was playing well and I was just in the zone. I didn’t know 62 was the lowest ever, but now it makes it even more special. If my caddie knew, he never said anything; good on him!” American Dustin Johnson, the world No 1, made a significant move up the leaderboard by collecting six birdies in his first 15 holes to get to 3-under. Heavy rain and swirling crosswinds had made scoring difficult in the second round but the sun came out yesterday and the world’s top players took full advantage. Local favourite Tommy Fleetwood, the world No 14, gave the home fans something to cheer about with a fine round of 66, and former world No 1 Jason Day of Australia shot 65 to move to level par.
