Cape Town - The Gang and Drug Task Team made eleven arrests during a joint operation in three separate stings on Monday night. "Eleven suspects who were rounded up by Metro Police in Macassar, Elsies River and Hanover Park," mayoral committee member for safety and security; and social services JP Smith said. "Last night (Monday), the Gang and Drug Task Team had a joint operation with the Macassar SAPS. They searched various premises on the back of tip-offs received and arrested nine suspects for possession of drugs. The suspects were aged between 16 and 47. Officers also confiscated 239 bankies of tik, 24 dagga ‘stoppe’ and a parcel of dagga, R34 370 in cash, drug tools including a bag of tik pipes and four walkie-talkies. "In Elsies River, officers arrested a 30-year-old suspect. They were on patrol in Avonwood when they noticed the suspect behaving in a suspicious manner. Officers searched him and found 28 dagga ‘stoppe’ in his possession. "In the early hours of Monday morning, officers were on patrol in Downburg Road, Hanover Park when they spotted a group of people standing on a corner. As officers approached the group, one of them bolted. He was soon apprehended and could not provide a satisfactory reason for running away. Officers searched the 25-year-old and found an imitation firearm in his possession. "These are all very good successes, brought about by information received from the community as well as hyper-vigilance during patrols. We will continue to devote as much resources as possible to gang and drug hotspots so we can clamp down on these activities. We further urge the public to continue providing intelligence that we can use to direct our enforcement efforts," Smith said.
