This after the institution suspended classes following a protest on Monday. Workers and students at the university's Bellville campus brought the institution to a standstill demanding the end of outsourcing of workers and that charges be withdrawn against students who participated in protest action over the past two years. Student Representative Council (SRC) member, Mbaliyizwe Madikizela said students were supporting the workers as their issues and the #FeesMustFall (FMF) student movement could not be separated. “While an agreements was reached in November, their (university's) communication on progress has been very weak. ‘‘New contracts were to be signed and because the university is not communicating to them they believe nothing is being done.” She said the decision to suspend activities was contentious and may result in further unrest due to ongoing and un-addressed issues 
stemming from last year's protests. Acting vice-chancellor Chris Nhlapo said the decision to suspend campus activities followed consultation with the chairperson of the university's council and was taken in the interests of the safety of staff and students. The emergency meeting was scheduled be held to discuss the issue of in-sourced workers and their contracts today. A student activist, who asked for his name to be withheld, said the emergency council meeting must address these matters and the situation regarding students still facing charges in the wake of the agreement that was reached. Workers were now in the process of unifying on the campus and were 
moving towards self representation rather than working through unions, said the student. CPUT spokesperson Lauren Kansley said there would be no further updates until today's council meeting concludes and that the university hopes to resume activities tomorrow.  dominic.adriaanse@inl.co.za
