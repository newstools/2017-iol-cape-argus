Cape Town - The ward councillor for Pelican Park has promised to meet with angry residents who protested over a number of issues on Thursday morning. Shanen Rossouw said she would take their grievances to city officials and report back to the community leaders on Friday. "I am going now to Cape Town to meet with the officials and I promise I will meet with the community leadership tomorrow." The residents clashed with each other and the police.    Residents of Phumlani Village are angry about the fact that houses had been given to residents in the New Horizons development. "There's no such thing as a housing waiting list," Phumlani resident Thabisa Mago said. "I've been living here for 30 years in this trash."    Residents of Jim se Bos also joined the protest. "I have been living here for 30 years and I don't have any electricity. It's frustrating and I have children who need to bath," community leader Patricia Masizana said.    The residents have a long list of complaints for their ward councillor to take to the council. Among them is a lack of adequate sewage and waste removal. There is an overflowing drain spilling raw sewage onto the muddy streets. There are only three toilets in Phumlani Village servicing some 20 families. The toilets no longer flush and have become blocked, with human waste spilling over onto the floor.    Earlier on Thursday morning, residents clashed with each other and the police. Some residents threw stones at the officers, who retaliated with stun grenades. Protester blockaded roads and burnt tyres and other debris. By noon, the police had managed to disperse the residents who back away saying they "don't want to be shot".  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
