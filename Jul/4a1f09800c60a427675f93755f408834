Joseph Payne, 21, from Georgia in the US started his initiative after spending weeks at a rural development agency during an internship programme. Cape Town-based Dockda focuses on rural areas with limited resources and no government funding. After joining Dockda in early June, Payne saw children walking kilometres to school without any adult supervision. Some children didn’t even have shoes. He quickly found out from the community that violence and kidnapping is a daily fear. Haunted by a feeling of  helplessness, Payne decided to create a crowd-funding initiative called Backabuddy. “The bicycles will help children get to school faster and easier, improving their academic achievement and decreasing their risk to violence,” said Payne. To raise funds, he plans to walk in the shoes of the children he is fund-raising for, by climbing Devil’s Peak, Table Mountain and Lion’s Head, a distance of 15km (the average distance these children walk on a daily basis) on July 22. The aim is to raise funds to buy at least five bikes. One bicycle, including transport to Kuruman, costs R3 700. *  If you would like to support Payne to provide children in the Northern Cape with transport to school, donate to his Crowdfunding Campaign on Backabuddy: https://www.backabuddy.co.za/champion/project/hiking-for-cycling-to-education.
