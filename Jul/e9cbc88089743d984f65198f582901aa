This time, Keegan-Lee ‘Apple’ Croy, 10, reigns supreme as the Western Cape Modelling Champion in her age group. Apple was named the overall winner at the show in Bellville on Saturday where she won four gold medals and a platinum sash. Earlier this year Apple was crowned Miss Pre-Teen SA 2017. The young diva says it was her interview with the panel of judges which bagged her the highest honours in the competition, the platinum sash. “I was asked by the panel what I would do as a 10-year-old to change the world, and I responded: ‘I would change women child and drug abuse. Drugs are destroying our families and killing children’. “I really wasn’t expecting to win the competition; there were girls who attended who beat me before. “I am so overwhelmed by winning, I don’t even have space for my crowns; my grandma probably has to make more space,” she smiles. Apple also won gold in the Catwalk, Evening Wear, Casual Ramps and the Photogenic categories. She adds: “I love school and my favourite subject is Mathematics. During the holidays I could not go to the modelling school because it was winter and we have to take three taxis to get to Durbanville, so I just practised by myself at home. “I just want to say thank you to my grandfather, Vivian. If it wasn’t for him I would never be able to get to my pageants.” Proud ouma Daphne Croy says Apple has the backing of her family and their community. “People sometimes have the wrong impression about pageants, what they don’t know is no make-up can be worn, dresses have to be a certain length and judge’s check whether you are child-like in every sense,” says Daphne. Apple will be hosting her own pageant 29 & 30 July 2017, where some girls from her community will wear her dresses that no longer fit. “It is usually held in our court [St. Lucia Court] but because of the ongoing gang violence, it will be in the civic centre,” Daphne says. The FREE show starts at 2pm and everyone is welcome. Story originally published in Daily Voice.
