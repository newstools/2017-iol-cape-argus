Residents in Wolwerivier, a City of Cape Town relocation area 30km outside the city, didn’t want to seem ungrateful because the structures are better 
than what they used to have, but there 
are no jobs and other infrastructure 
close by. Wolwerivier was established two years ago and the city has announced that it will be building 4 500 houses there. The city’s mayco member for transport and urban development, Brett Herron, said: “The development plan for Wolwerivier will identify the development yield, the likely number of housing units, the phasing and the services and amenities required to support a functional community. “At this stage all we have done is advertise a tender to do the planning. “The service providers, once appointed, will assist with the town planning aspects as well as the environmental impact  assessment.” Thembisa Kondlo, 32, who had stayed near Skandaalkamp, said that she has been staying in Wolwerivier for the past two years. “We are thankful for a roof over our heads, but there are no schools for the children here. I am also unemployed and you cannot buy food if you do not have money.” Another resident, Maranata Lotriet, who stays with her boyfriend and two children in Wolwerivier, said: “Our biggest problem is when we need to go to a hospital What if there is an emergency and the ambulance cannot find the place? There is also no work here, at least in Skandaalkamp, we were near to places where we could get stuff to sell and I could make a pot of food every night.” People from Albert Road and Bromwell Street in Woodstock had said they would not relocate to Wolwerivier.  rusana.philander@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
