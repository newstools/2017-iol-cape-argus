Cape Town - The Cape Argus was given an exclusive look inside the temporary structures erected by the City of Cape Town in response to the devastating March fire that left thousands of Imizamo Yethu residents homeless. The Hout Bay informal settlement erupted in protests over the weekend and into Monday over the lack of housing and service delivery in the area. Residents claim they were promised formal structures within three months, but four months after the blaze, they are still living in the temporary zinc and wood structures. The structures are erected in close proximity to one another on private land some of the residents say the land owners want back. One resident, Deborah Mkaphuza, claims they are not welcome in the Hout Bay community. The uniform structures are small - measuring 4m by 4m - have no electricity, running water, or sewage, no windows, just one door, and the floor is nothing more than cold, wet ground. These Imizamo Yethu residents explain why they are protesting. Video: Marvin Charles Mkaphuza said the city council provides plastic sheeting to cover the ground, which residents can then cover with carpets or rugs &quot;if we can afford it&quot;. The plastic sheets covering the ground inside the shacks are dirty. Many of the residents are not by the means to set up make-shift flooring. The shacks smell of earthy soil and moisture.&nbsp; This is the homes that was given to residents that was affected by the blaze. This resident says that he wants to see action. @TheCapeArgus pic.twitter.com/m6cmGBUG32</p>Tell a friendSia Ndude explains that the shacks get very cold at night.

Ndude sniffed and coughed as he explained that the shacks got so cold during the night, they would often find their blankets soaked by condensation. &quot;You see this? This is why we are demonstrating out here.&quot;</p> Marvin Charles (@MarvinCharles17) July 3, 2017</blockquote>
