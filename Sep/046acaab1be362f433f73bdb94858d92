Cape Town - A protest over the allocation of fishing quotas turned violent in Hout Bay on Tuesday. Residents blocked roads with burning debris and pelted law enforcement officials and police members with missiles. "Numerous Metro Police, TRU (Tactical Response Unit) and Law Enforcement staff deployed to assist SAPS in Hout Bay," Cape Town mayoral committee member for safety and security; and social services JP Smith said. "Two City staff were injured by attacks. One officer hospitalised - injury is not serious fortunately.Â He has been booked off. "Rioters firing signal flares at police and SAPS helicopter and they managed to create fire on one of SAPS Nyalas - extent of damage unclear. "City enforcement staff will remain on site until late tonight and will extend presence if necessary. "The City understands that protestors may have serious complaints relating to fishing quotas but the legitimacy of their cause is completely undermined by the violence they engaged in and the damage to private and public infrastructure which must be condemned in the most explicit terms," Smith said.
