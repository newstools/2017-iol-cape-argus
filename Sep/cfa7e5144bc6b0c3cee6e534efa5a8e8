It is the first time that break-dancing has been entered into the Youth Olympic Games. The second round competition takes place on October 22 in Germany. The finals of the competition takes place later in October in Buenos Aires in Argentina. Zenath Jacobs explained that as a B-Girl it has always been her dream to dance on an international stage. “I have a dance group called Free Expression with my other sisters Zureida, 13, and Kauthar, 15, and this is how I started dancing. I always saw them dancing and one day I asked them to teach me. Now we dance together. Dancing is part of us. It is my dream to become the best B Girl in South Africa and a professional dancer. I am very excited to go to Germany, but we have not raised all the funds yet, but my mom has been working really hard with fundraising,” she said. Her mom, Yushra Jacobs, who is also a former dancer, explained that she is very proud of her daughters. “I want to realise Zenath’s dream. She is a good kid and has worked very hard to qualify for the competition and I don’t want to disappoint her. She is practising very hard every day, sometimes up to four hours. I have raised some of the funds for our travelling fees, but not all of it,” she said. Angelo van Wyk, one of Zenath’s coaches, said he is very happy that break-dancing has been entered for the first time as a sport into the Youth Olympic Games, “because break-dancing is not being recognised as a sport, but our children love it”. “And it’s a form of expressing themselves. All of us are very proud of Zenath. She is very talented and has been working very hard,” he said.
