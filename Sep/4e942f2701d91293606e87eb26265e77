Cape Town - Thousands took to the streets along with the Muslim Judicial Council and other local faith based organisations to raise awareness about the ongoing genocide against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. The march started in Keizersgracht Street and ended at the gates of Parliament where activists and religious leaders vented their grievances about the on going violence.    The local military in Myanmar began cracking down on Rohingya Muslims in the country last year, in response to attacks on border police by unidentified insurgents.

As a result, at least 370 000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh with at least 400 people killed and more than 160 000 left destitute, according to humanitarian organisation Islamic Relief. The United Nations reported earlier this month that more than 120 000 Rohingya fled Myanmar for Bangladesh.    "Today we gather and our hearts are broken to see how many innocent people have died," MJC deputy president Moulana Abdul Khaliq Allie said. "We are saying to South Africa and to our government to please take up this responsibility to speak in favour of the well being of humanity." The MJC womenâ€™s forum addressed the march saying that genocide is taking place.    "The graphic footage, including the information we have received from Myanmar via social media, speaks of an atrocity, a heinous crime, a genocide; and it's happening now," forum chairperson Mualima Khadija Patel-Allie said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
