The Dolutegravir drug, a first in South Africa, also has had no major cases of side-effects reported, researchers revealed. Francois Venter, deputy executive director of Wits Reproductive Health, HIV and Related Diseases, said they saw the success of the new drug throughout Europe and America, and it was recently introduced in Botswana and Brazil. “You have a mature treatment programme, but the HIV problem in South Africa is still unbelievably high. "We’ve still got between 700 and 1000 new infections a day, and even though that has come right down over the past 20 years, it’s still catastrophic. "This drug will be a major step forward in the fight against HIV as it's safer and has a much higher resistance barrier. The world is slowly moving to using the drug and it has been used widely only in the last four years with great results. "We're not sure yet if it will first be introduced in one province, then extended to other provinces. The patients will take one small tablet daily as all the drugs are in one pill. ” Venter said Dolutegravir would replace the current drug efavirenz and would drop the price of first-line antiretroviral therapy from about $120 (R1600) a year to $75 a year, and maybe lower in the years after that. Venter is a physician who researches new drugs. Much of his work is about making tablets safer, smaller and cheaper. Desmond Tutu HIV Foundation community advisory board member Nombeko Mpongo said she was very happy that the new drug was finally coming, adding that it was long overdue.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
