Leon Groeneveld, owner of The Duck Farm, which provided duck meat products and eggs to the market, is devastated. “We lost 10 917 to bird flu and a further 24 580 were culled. Then on the breeding farm, which is about 5km away, about 3 500 ducks were culled.” Groeneveld said the financial loss was around R4 million and he also had to let go all his staff. “My staff were working on the farm looking after the ducks or slaughtering, processing or cooling. I have no stock, no ducks and no work, they all had to go.” Groeneveld said they noticed the first sick duck on August 21. By Friday, all the birds had been killed. “I started as a young man, going door-to-door accumulating my assets and I sold it all to buy the duck farm I have plans to start the business again. I’m hoping to get the abattoir ready and get some chickens and at least give jobs to between 60 and 80 people.” The staff was notified of the company’s woes last week. Shireen van der Merwe said she loved her job and was stressed about having to look for another job. “Finding a job isn’t easy. I worked there for two years and I.” Cape Argus
