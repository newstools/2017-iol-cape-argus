Cape Town - Calling on President Jacob Zuma to step down, trade union federation Cosatu voiced its support for deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed him when it marched on Parliament on Wednesday. The parliamentary precinct was the last stop of the Cape Town leg of Cosatu's national shutdown, before the thousands of supporters dispersed.    "We are saying we down with Zuma today, down! Down with the people who steal our money, down," Cosatu’s provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich said.    "We need to stand up against the goliath of corruption," the Muslim Judicial Council's Sheikh Ighsaan Taliep said. "What South Africa needs as a society is an ethical leadership." Parliament's Divisions Manager Mabatho Zungu accepted Cosatu’s memorandum and said Parliament would respond to the trade union federation.    Executive director of the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry Sid Peimer accepted the memorandum on behalf of business. Protesters then returned to the starting point of the march in Keizersgracht Street, from where they dispersed peacefully.    The City of Cape Town estimated there were at most 2 500 people in the crowd at any given time, however, other educated estimates put the number at more than 5 000.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
