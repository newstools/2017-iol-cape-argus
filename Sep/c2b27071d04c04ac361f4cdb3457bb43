The funds are set to be used for infrastructure development which includes social housing, student accommodation, upgrading of informal settlements and acquiring land for the development of human settlements. “South Africa is facing urbanisation challenges as young people move to cities to seek better economic opportunities. With this financial commitment we are enabling provinces and metros to respond to these challenges, including student accommodation needs and adequate housing for low-income earners,” Sisulu said. Her department would work closely with mayors to ensure that the funds were not used for anything other than what they have been allocated for,” she said. “Property owners have a responsibility to ensure that their properties are guarded. When they see illegal occupations taking place they must act immediately and report it to law-enforcement agencies. *  will be meeting with property owners to indicate my views about this. Municipalities and law-enforcement agencies must take action immediately when cases of illegal occupations have been reported,” she said. Over the past few years, metropolitan areas have experienced an increase in its population size, Sisulu said. In a presentation by Piet van Zyl, head of department at Environmental Affairs and Development Planning, earlier this year, he showed how the population in the province was  forecast to continue to grow over the next few years. He said the population was expected to increase by over 32% over the next 25 years, while urban population would grow from 4.2 million to 6.2 million over the next 25 years. Mayoral committee member for finance, Johan van der Merwe, said the City had not been made aware of the allocation of funds for this purpose. “We have also engaged the National Treasury for clarity, but they are also unaware of this decision. We will comment once the issue has been clarified,” he said.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
