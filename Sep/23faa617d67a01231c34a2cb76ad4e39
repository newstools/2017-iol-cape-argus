The NSRI Table Bay sea rescue craft Spirit of Day and Spirit of Vodacom was launched to join the Robben Island passenger ferry Madiba 1 that were already at the scene. The NSRI launched four other boats. The police Sea Borderline launched a craft, as did the Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. Rescue helicopters were put on standby and a Joint Operations Control was set up . Rescuers found the Thandi listing to one side. Some of the passengers were in life rafts and the remaining crew and passengers were on the deck. All passengers and crew owere transferred by NSRI from the ferry and life rafts onto the Madiba 1 and onto NSRI's Spirit of Vodacom and brought to port where they were assessed by paramedics. A few passengers were treated for mild hypothermia but did not need to go to hospital. One woman crew member from the Madiba 1 was taken to hospital after suffering from an anxiety attack. As a precaution, a woman passenger from the stricken Thandi was transported to hospital suffering from back pain. Both are in a stable condition Robben Island Museum spokesperson Chris Bischoff could not confirm whether the ferry in question belonged to the museum. The South African Maritime Safety Authority have been alerted and an investigation will take place. Efforts are being made to recover the ferry.
