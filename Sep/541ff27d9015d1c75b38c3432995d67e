"The CPF fielded calls from angry and upset community members about this loss of a young life. Another childâ€™s life is snatched away because of illegal firearms in the area." Bam also pleaded with the community to stay calm and not take their frustrations out on police. "Damaging the very resources that must help us is not the kind of response expected from responsible citizens. We have warned in the past that the frustration of the community with the criminal justice system will spill over into irrational reaction and (we) urge the police to leave no stone unturned in bringing the perpetrator and his ilk to book."  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
