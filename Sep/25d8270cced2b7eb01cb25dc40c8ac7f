The festival is dedicated to raising awareness about the plight of the endangered African penguins. It will be jam-packed with exciting events for all ages. “In 2016, the festival was an absolute success, over 3 500 people attended,” said Sanccob marketing and fundraising officer Ronnis Daniels. The event is set to start at 10am on Seaforth Beach, and those penguins are ready for the wild after rehabilitation will be released. “This is an exclusive opportunity for the public; they get to witness rehabilitated birds getting released into the ocean. This is always exciting and heart-warming,” Daniels said. “This is not just a fundraising event, it is also about raising awareness about African penguins. The event also allows different organisations to make presentations and awareness about other seabirds.” After the penguin release, the festivities will begin at Simon’s Town sports fields. Admission is free, while the “Kids Zone” will cost R50. Cape Argus
