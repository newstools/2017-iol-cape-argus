It also wants to seize any work that KPMG is performing for Sars and assess the work it has performed in the last 10 years. Moyane said they would report KPMG to Parliament through the standing committee on public accounts and standing committee on finance to investigate its conduct. The Independent Regulatory Board for Auditors (IRBA) said it would continue its investigations. Chief executive Bernard Agulhas said the  IRBA would continue with its own independent investigation. “The IRBA intends to meet with the new team at KPMG to discuss their remedial action programmes which will be regularly monitored by the IRBA,” he said. Mnyamezeli Booi, the ANC whip on the Standing Committee on Public Accounts, said: “While we welcome KPMG admitting that their report on SARS lacked sufficient evidence to conclude findings of a “rogue unit”, and offering to repay the R23 million fee it received for the work performed for SARS, we are of the view that KPMG must account on its involvement in what appears to be politically motivated immoral and unethical conduct,” Booi said. Parliament’s finance committee chairperson, Yunus Carrim, said representatives of KMPG and Deloitte would appear before the committee on October 3.  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
