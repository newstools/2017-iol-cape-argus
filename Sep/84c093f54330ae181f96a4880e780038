One such place is Triggerfish Brewing, focusing on brewing a wide range of exceptional beers. Traditionally known for the beers as their product range consists to date  of nine staple beers,  16 seasonal and a one-off “wild” beer. “Wild” beers have flavours most local beer drinkers don’t typically experience. Triggerfish Brewery also has a delicious meal of the day, which is highly recommended. It offers an array of tapas and main meals that can be paired with their specialised beers. They also have on offer “beer snacks” such as chips, bitterballen, kaasballen and jalepeno poppers. For mains they have fried chicken waffles, served with coleslaw and Cajun maple sauce; also speciality burgers such as Triggerfish Chili Burger, a 200gm beef with spicy hot mince patty, cheddar and cream cheese. Triggerfish Brewery’s menu also caters for children. A visit is a worthwhile pitstop. Cape Argus
