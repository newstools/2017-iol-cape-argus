Jayde van der Byl from Blikkiesdorp will be leaving for Germany next week and will be representing his school in Bridgetown. And it's all thanks to mayor Patricia de Lille, who gave R23 000 towards Jayde’s travelling costs. In May, the Cape Argus published Jayde's story and since then, there had been an outpouring of support. “I help young people all the time; there is such a lot of potential and sometimes they just need that little bit of help. I read about him in the Cape Argus and then I said let's go and find him,” De Lille said. At a special meeting yesterday in the mayor's chambers at the Civic Centre, De Lille handed over Jayde’s passport. Jayde was accompanied by a group of fellow team members, as well as his parents. Jayde’s father, Errol, couldn't be more proud. “I am overwhelmed, it's difficult to speak when your dreams actually come true. Today, I am standing in the mayor's office, a couple of months back I didn't know where I would find myself. It's all through the newspapers that made this possible.” The international tournament is set to take place from September 29 to October 12.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
