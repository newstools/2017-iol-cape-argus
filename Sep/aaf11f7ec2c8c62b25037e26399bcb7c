Both Twigg and August have confirmed they will be running, while the youngest member of the Western Cape Legislature, Daylin Mitchell, confirmed he will be standing for deputy regional chairperson. All eyes will be on August, who is seen as a close ally of Cape Town mayor and former provincial party leader Patricia de Lille. “I feel very confident about the leadership race. I have been nominated by many of my DA  colleagues. My job is to ensure that we boost the DA’s chances in 2019 and the metro region plays a pivotal role in reaching that goal,” he said. August said he looks forward to the new executive team and is “not at all” worried about his opponents. “If elected, I will be the captain of the ship and I will steer it in the right direction. I am not worried about Grant (Twigg). I wish him all of the best,” August said. Twigg did not respond to calls for comment, but on his Facebook page he posted a picture with the caption: “Together we will achieve our goals and take the DA Metro to another level.” Twigg has also been across the Metro, speaking at events to mobilise support for his campaign. Other prominent DA  leaders who are also running for Mitchell’s deputy chairperson position include Western Cape Legislature Speaker Sharna Fernandez and mayoral committee members Anda Ntsodo and JP Smith. Mitchell said he wants to grow the DA  support: “Our growth in the metro will ensure that we achieve our bigger goal of unseating the ANC." Other positions up for grabs at the conference are three deputies a secretary chairperson for finance and four additional members. So far only sub-council 21 chairman Malusi Booi announced that he is availing himself as an additional member. Subcouncil 21 includes Kuils River, Blue Downs and Eersterivier. Whoever becomes regional chairperson has a lot of sway on who becomes provincial leader.  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
