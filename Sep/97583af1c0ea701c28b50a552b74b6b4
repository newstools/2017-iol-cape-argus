Not to worry, the Playstation in Tokai has you covered. The massive indoor play area is designed to give your kids a workout and keep them busy for hours, with mazes, jungle gyms, slides, obstacle courses, dress-up and fantasy stations and a climbing wall, among other things. Friendly, trained staff keep an eye on the little ones while the parents enjoy delicious food and drinks from the café. There’s also a separate area for toddlers so they don’t get in the way of the bigger kids. An hour’s play will set you back between R60 and R85 while a two-hour Adventure pass costs between R100 and R150. What’s more, you can book online, and they cater for parties with convenient nooks for birthday cake and goodie bags. The café’s menu boasts imported coffees, gourmet sandwiches, waffles and other confectionery to die for. If you’re looking to get your kids out of your hair for a few hours while also enjoying a good meal and catching up with your friends, you can’t go wrong with the Playstation, conveniently situated in the South Palms shopping centre on Main Road, Tokai.
