Cape Town - The University of Cape Town has struck a deal with contract workers of the university. This comes after lengthy negotiations took place between union representatives and the university's management. UCT’s executive board said two points had been resolved and an agreement had been reached, putting the brakes on a proposed strike. "We are pleased to report that the two outstanding points were resolved and an agreement reached that puts an end to the threat of strike action," vice-chancellor Dr Max Price said. "The agreement establishes a joint consultative forum and a small special task team on which all recognised trade unions may be represented to tackle any residual issues following the insourcing exercise last year." In addition both parties have agreed to a study that will assess reasonable staffing levels across operations, with priority given to the insourced operations. They also resolved concerns about pregnant employees who work shifts. Prior to this they also agreed that over 61 temporary four-hour shift workers will be made full-time employees by November 1. The workers will also be given additional payment for hours worked on Sundays and at night. "We believe that the spirit in which negotiations were conducted, involving representatives of five different trade unions, provides a positive signal that effective collective bargaining is possible even with multiple parties and in an extremely challenging financial environment," Price said. Last week, students and workers threatened to shut down the university if their demands were not met. The university’s management secured an interdict against the proposed strike at the time.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
