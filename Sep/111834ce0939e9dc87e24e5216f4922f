Cape Town - Frustrated insourced workers chanted “I am not afraid to speak” at a mass meeting held in the Jameson Hall at the University of Cape Town on Wednesday. The meeting follows the cancellation of a planned strike by insourced workers, which was to be supported by students. The strike and protest were cancelled after the university managed to secure an interdict against them. Workers and students were unhappy about private security being deployed on the Rondebosch campus during a meeting between workers and management. One of the workers, Nozizwe Beye said: "We are sick of these delay tactics. The money I get from UCT is nothing. From now on I am not going to be quiet." A representative told the Cape Argus another meeting with management would take place on Thursday. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that

The workers have submitted a list of demands, among them, seven-hour shifts for workers who currently work four-hour shifts, a 25% shift allowance, and double time for working on Sundays and public holidays. Before the march was set to get under way, UCT said in a statement it would take action against anyone who tried to interfere with academic activities. It also said action would be taken against those who sought to shut down the university, which could see the institution lose between R300- and R500 million.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
