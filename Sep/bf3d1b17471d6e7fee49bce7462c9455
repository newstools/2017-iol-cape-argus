Cape Town - Trade union federation Cosatu wants Metrorail bosses thrown behind bars for their role in endangering the lives of commuters who face an unreliable rail service and criminal activity on a daily basis. This was among the demands listed in a memorandum handed over to the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) on Wednesday. The Prasa offices was the first stop on Cosatu's march through Cape Town's CBD, whereafter they planned to march to the Western Cape Provincial Legislature and then on to Parliament. It forms part of Cosatu's national shutdown. Cosatu also demanded Metrorail's ticket prices be slashed. "We want these prices reduced because remember when you arrive late at work the bosses deduct that money from your salary," provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich said. "We want the taxi prices to be reduced. We want the MyCiTi buses to be run on the Cape Flats."   Ehrenreich also slammed the crime plaguing the rail service, its stations and staff. "We want Metrorail bosses to be jailed for endangering our lives," he said.Â "They know they are playing with the lives of the people." Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said Prasa understands the frustrations of commuters. "We will be analysing the demands and will respond in writing," Walker said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  @MarvinCharles17 Cape Argus
