“The competition was challenging,” Kieran said. “The first few days had excellent weather and then it got really windy and it was a very tough course, but I think I played really well and I feel great about winning. I’ve never felt better!” Kieran said his love for golf was ignited when he was 5 years old. “My dad took me to the driving range and I enjoyed the competition and the feeling of hitting a good shot,” he said. He added that the unpredictability of the sport gave him a rush. “The fact that you can play one shot badly and then play the next one so well and how you never know what’s happening next, I like that about the game.” The young champion said his biggest inspiration was Northern Irish professional golfer Rory McIlroy, and he aspired to be like him. He hoped to make it through to the Junior World Championship next July, when golfers from all over compete for a Junior Tour card which gives the winner the privilege to travel the world. “I play golf every day. I used to be crazy about soccer, but now I love golf more,” he said. Kieran thanked his father, Craig Urquhart, for this. Craig says golf makes his son happy and although there are challenges, like him spending an incredible amount of money on new equipment, coaching and courses, he doesn’t mind because he knows how passionate his son is. “I really hope he qualifies for Junior World Champs in the United States, that would be great for him because he will get to travel the world. I know golf gives him continuous deep happiness and he shows commitment,” Kieran’s father said. Kieran said that his coach, Quintin van der Berg, also contributed majorly to his success through long hours of practising and finessing his skills. “He is a very gifted man,” his coach added.  naledi.mohono@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
