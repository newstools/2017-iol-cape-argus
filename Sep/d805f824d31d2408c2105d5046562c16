Johannesburg - Orlando Pirates FC star Happy Jele on Monday found himself on the wrong side of the law when he was arrested for speeding and reckless driving. Gauteng MEC for Community Safety, Sizakele Nkosi-Malobane, said that the provincial traffic police high-speed unit arrested Jele early Monday morning while he was travelling with his BMW 135i on the M1 near Sandton at an average speed of 223km/h. 
 
In a statement, Nkosi-Malobane said Jele had claimed that he was on his way to attend to his sick child when the officers managed to stop him. But it was determined that the information was untruthful and just an excuse and Jele was arrested and taken to Sandton police station where he was formally charged for reckless driving and exceeding the prescribed limit of 120km/h. Jele's bail has not been determined as yet, and he will appear in the Randburg Magistrate's Court later on Monday. Nkosi-Malobane condemned the incident. "I am disappointed at Happy Jele’s driving behaviour and conduct. Professional players are supposed to be role models and safety ambassadors," Nkosi-Malobane said. "The law enforcement agencies will not tolerate lawlessness behaviour on Gauteng roads, especially with the high rate of fatalities reported in the province." Jele is one of the longest serving players for Orlando Pirates, having captained the team and also played for the national soccer team, Bafana Bafana.
 
Nkosi-Malobane appealed to motorists to drive with caution and abide by the rules of the road at all times. African News Agency
