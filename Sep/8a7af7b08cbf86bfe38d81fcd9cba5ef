Cape Town - A man has died after being run over by a train at Bellville station. The incident occurred on Wednesday evening when he attempted to cross the tracks from one platform to another. "When ER24 paramedics arrived on scene at 18H15, they found the man lying on the platform next to the train," ER24 spokesperson Ineke van Huyssteen said. "Despite their best efforts to resuscitate the man, he unfortunately succumbed to his injuries. It is unclear whether the man fell from the train." Three other men were injured and were taken to hospital. "An inquest docket has been opened for investigation in Bellville after a man in his late twenties got fatally wounded when he was run over by a train at Bellville Train Station," police spokesperson Sinathi Joni said. "Circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated."

Trains operate on fixed infrastructure and cannot take evasive action or stop immediately even if travelling at slow speeds."
