Lynn Joseph said she grew up loving beautiful dresses and over the years bought quite a few, which were just hanging in her closet. She decided to share the dresses with other young girls who would not have dresses to go to their matric balls. "I want other young girls to also feel beautiful when they are wearing a dress. Not having a beautiful dress to wear must not keep a girl from going to her matric ball. I would like other girls to also experience a beautiful matric ball. Growing up, I also did not have dresses to wear when I went to special occasions, so I understand what it is like growing up and not having something nice to wear,” she said. Danielle Brickles, a teacher at one of the schools which received some of the dresses, said that she was very happy that some of the pupils were helped with dresses. “A matric ball is a big thing for most girls and sometimes some of them do not have dresses to wear. Due to this they miss their matric balls. The
dresses are such a great help to them,”
she said. Girls who still need matric ball dresses can contact her at
