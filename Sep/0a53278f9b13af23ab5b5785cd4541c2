Cape Town - British woman Tracey Jennings is offering a R6 500 reward for her travelling companion and teddy bear after he went missing in Cape Town on September 2. Bob was last seen at 2pm in a V&A Marina complex in Cape Town. Jennings realised he was missing three hours later, after she dropped a friend off at the airport, and suspects that Bob dropped out of her handbag or was stolen. The teddy bear holds sentimental value and is not just an ordinary teddy bear. "I know he is just a teddy bear but he was a gift from one of my greatest friends and flatmates at university who subsequently committed suicide," she said on social media. Jennings is a well-travelled photographer who specialises in wildlife and scuba diving pictures. Jennings has had Bob for 25 yearsÂ and has travelled the world with her.. "I feel I have let both my friend Robert and Bob down. I miss Bob. He is my best friend."  I need social media help . Bob had gone missing. I know he is just a teddy bear but he was a gift from one of my greatest friends and flat mates at University who subsequently committed suicide. He was supposed to watch over me .. and I over him. It was the last thing my friend said to me. Travelling with Bob was like Robert still being around. He was last seen at 2pm in my rental apartment in CPT today at the V&A Marina complex (2nd September) and I realised he was missing at 5pm. In the meantime I dropped a friend off at the airport and returned home. I cannot believe he is missing - he must have dropped out of my bag or was stolen. Spent the last 5 hours searching the apartment, car, spoke to security, drove to the airport, spoke to the police at the airport. I have posted a 1000 ZAR reward with the airport and security. Any ideas of what else to do ? I'd pay more if I thought that it would help him be found faster ..if you know anyone to share with it would be appreciated. Maybe social media can help. Early that day he was at the V&A waterfront with me. @capetown.southafrica @capetown A post shared by Bob the Bear (@bobthebearesq) on Sep 2, 2017 at 10:06pm PDT   Sunset on the river #teddyfriends #teddytravel #teddybear #sunset #africa #botswana #chobe A post shared by Bob the Bear (@bobthebearesq) on Aug 5, 2017 at 9:27am PDT   Scary #toystragram #toytravel #aucklandmuseum #crocodile #auckland A post shared by Bob the Bear (@bobthebearesq) on Jun 21, 2017 at 10:02pm PDT   Double trouble #ginloversofinstagram #ginloversmagazine #teddybear #teddytravel #teddyfriends #kualalumpur #malaysia #tapas @mercatgastrobar A post shared by Bob the Bear (@bobthebearesq) on Jul 28, 2017 at 9:28pm PDT  In her desperate bid to find Bob, she searched the apartment, her vehicle, spoke to security as well as police. She is also expected to distribute posters soon. "There is a $500 (about R6 500) reward for his safe return," she told Independent Online. Robert's (her friend) last request was that she looks after him - and he after her. "The last conversation I had with my friend included the promise to look after Bob." "Travelling with Bob was like Robert still being around." IOL
