Cape Town - Online entries to the highly anticipated 2018 edition of the Cape Town Cycle Tour open on Wednesday, September 20. The 2017 race - the 40th edition Cycle Tour - had to be cancelled due to bad weather. Next year's edition of the world's biggest timed cycle race has been quirkily nicknamed #40take2 on social media by the tour's organisers. Those who registered for the 2017 tour were given preferential treatment for the 2018 race, marketing, media and sponsorship director David Bellairs said. “Emails were sent out in batches to every rider who entered and registered for the 2017 Cape Town Cycle Tour at this year’s Cape Town Cycle Tour Expo,” Bellairs said. “The offer of a guaranteed entry to the 2018 Cape Town Cycle Tour, at 2017 entry fee rates, had to be taken up by 4pm on 13 September. After this date and time the Preferential Entry was forfeited – those wishing to enter may still join the General Application process for entries.” Cyclists who had participated in 21 or more races have been invited to enter from Wednesday, September 13, until Tuesday, September 19. General entries open at 1pm on September 20, and prospective riders can visit capetowncycletour.com to enter. Applications will be allocated on a first come, first served basis and will close once 35 000 entries have been registered. Successful applicants will be notified by email between September 20 and 27. Those who are successful will then be given time until 4pm on September 27 to make the necessary payment to secure their entry. General Entry Application fee for South African applicants is R540 and for internationals, it is R1 000.
 
Unsuccessful applicants will also receive an email notification and will be invited to enter, either via supporting a charity or through the official substitution process during early 2018. In August the event organisers announced after talks with stakeholders that the starting point would be moved from Hertzog Boulevard to the Grand Parade.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
