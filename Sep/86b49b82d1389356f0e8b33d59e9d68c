Cape Town - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (IPID) is investigating an incident where police shot at partygoers in Manenberg in August. In a video posted by journalist Leigh-Anne Jansen, members of the police are seen shooting rubber bullets, scattering partygoers. Chairperson of the Manenberg CPF Kader Jacobs said neighbours called to complain about the party before police came and shot at the event. “They had a huge party and they put a tent that stretched out onto the pavement for all their revellers. The police were not aware until the complaints came in. The police saw the size of the event and called for backup and the stabilisation unit arrived, with public order police.”   He said police opened fire with rubber bullets after some partygoers verbally abused them and started pelting them with items. “No one got hurt, they cleared the place after that. Police shot rubber bullets on the floor.” IPID spokesperson Mosed Dlamini said they were aware of the video and were investigating the matter. “At this stage we are not aware as to the reasons for shooting at the victims - this will be established during the investigation. Police officers should exercise caution to avoid injuring or killing persons in the line of fire.” Full story in the Cape Argus on Tuesday Cape Argus
