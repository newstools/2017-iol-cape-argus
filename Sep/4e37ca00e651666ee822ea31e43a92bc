State witness Sibongiseni Kwatsha said he'd heard rumours that Mafevuka, 19, was getting married. “She had marriage plans, I heard about it. It was rumoured in the area, but I could not confirm it,” he said. Kwatsha has been living in Town Two, in Harare, for more than 10 years. He said he had known the deceased for a few months and was acquainted with the two accused, Xolisa Mafilika and his cousin Athabile Mafilika. He said he used to smoke with the two accused. Kwatsha said Mafevuka was in a relationship with Viwe Mafilika, a cousin to the accused. He said the weekend before Mafevuka’s body was found, he had met with Viwe at Thoko’s tavern. “He asked whether I hadn’t seen Sinoxolo and I told him no,” said Kwatsha. He added that on the Friday of the same weekend he was at Xolisa’s home to ask for a smoke. When handed the photo bundle with evidence found at the scene, Kwatsha identified a blue jersey as a jersey which was often worn by “Viwe’s girlfriend”. In cross-examination, advocate Mornay Calitz, representing Xolisa, said his client did not recall seeing Kwatsha on that Friday. “I was there with him,” Kwatsha contested. The case was postponed until October 9. The Statehas one more witness to call. The witness is in the Eastern Cape and has to be  brought to the province by the State. The State and defence also put on record that they would be finalising the issue of the bail record information. The defence had requested that some information recorded in the bail proceedings be excluded from trial. They claim some evidence was “hearsay” and could taint the court’s decision. On September 27, the two parties will meet and discuss which information can be included and which should be excluded. If there's failure to reach an agreement, the courts will have to intervene.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
