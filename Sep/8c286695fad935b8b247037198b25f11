Vumile Phalaza, who is disabled intellectually, epileptic and  indigent, was abandoned by his extended family to fend for himself. He was left to live with his son,  who acts as his only caregiver. Mpeta stated that the boy often misses school to take care of his father and she tries to share whatever she has with them. “This young boy's mother passed away, (so) he is the one taking care of his father. I make sure the child eats. I give him R2 every day for school and I make sure he is clean. I just want them to live in better conditions; they are not dogs. I want the government to help them. I will be at peace when they get help,” Mpeta said. After hearing the story, Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela and Social Development MEC Albert Fritz visited the home. They  ensured that Phalaza was assessed and sent to a health facility for a full check-up and treatment. The young boy was also assessed and, as per the Children’s Act of 2005, placed in temporary safe care. “Social workers will determine a more permanent arrangement to allow the boy access to schooling and his father,” said Fritz. “This case highlights the importance and need for community involvement.  We applaud the neighbours for their care and for alerting us.”  naledi.mohono@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
