Cape Town - This past weekend, Muslims around the world celebrated Eid al-Adha - the Feast of Sacrifice. It is the second of two global celebrations, commemorating the willingness of Ibrahim (Abraham) to sacrifice his son, an act of obedience to God's command. During this time, Muslims celebrate "days of remembrance", participating in sacred rituals commemorating important religious occurences as recorded in the Quran. As part of the celebration, Muslims who are by the means to do so also slaughter a domestic animal - a symbolic gesture echoing Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son. The meat from the animal is to be divided in thre parts: the first third goes to the family who slaughtered the animal, a second third goes to the relatives, while the final third should be given the the poor and needy. The regular charitable acts of Muslims are heightened during this holy time and special care is taken that the needy and impoverished are taken care of. Locally, hundreds of Muslims made their way to Qurbaan farm in Philippi, Cape Town, to purchase sheep for slaughter. Our photographer, Armand Hough, captured the process. You can check out all his pictures (some of which are graphic) on his Instagram account. Cape Argus
