Lauren Louw has, after only a year of aerobics, obtained provincial and national colours in the sport. According to the principal of Rosendaal High School, Chrizelda Layman, she is excelling on all levels. “Academically she is also one of our top learners. She plays netball, volleyball and does athletics. “Besides that she is also part of other activities at the school. She is very hard-working,” she said. “I did it last in primary school. I am part of an aerobics studio and the school helped me raise the funds for the club. “Also when I did not have shoes for the aerobics competition the school helped me. “I come from very difficult circumstances and the school helped me. “Ms Layman is my role model. I have applied to study sport management next year, but I have not received a bursary yet. Otherwise I would like to become a teacher one day,” she said. Layman added: “People do not understand the difficult circumstances many of these children come from. “That is why we are super proud of them when they excel. Every year we hold an awards ceremony to honour their achievements.”  rusana.philander@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
