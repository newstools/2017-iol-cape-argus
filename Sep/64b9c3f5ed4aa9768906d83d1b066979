“Much of the tension is linked to four student leaders who were suspended and are now no longer allowed on any CPUT campus. The suspension comes after their alleged continued involvement in campus disruptions. The decision to suspend these students was taken after several attempts at reconciliation from the university management were snubbed,” said the acting vice-chancellor, Dr Chris Nhlapo, in a statement on the CPUT Facebook page. “I was suspended for participating in the council meeting, I was attempting to resolve the issue between management and students. All I wanted to do was lead negotiations, and that was regarded as disruption,” said one of the suspended student leaders, Lukhanyo Vangqa. There were altercations between students and the police, which forced the police to fire stun grenades and rubber bullets. One private security member was injured by students and rushed to hospital. Later, the CPUT students moved to the City of Cape Town Library, where they forced people to vacate the building. Mphatheli Dyakopa, a Cape Town resident, was doing research in the library when he heard a commotion and was immediately asked to leave the library. “CPUT students came into the library and announced that all CPUT students must leave the library immediately. “They started dragging other people out of the library. One of the guys took a fire extinguisher and opened it in the library,” Dyakopa said.   Cape Argus
