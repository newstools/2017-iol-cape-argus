Ahead of June 16 commemorations, Phosa delivered the Oliver Tambo Memorial Lecture and called for a restoration of Tambo’s values, morals and ethics. “I agree to stand as a candidate. I did not decide on my own but was nominated,” Phosa told the crowd of about 200 people at KwaMfundo High School in Khayelitsha. He told the Cape Times he was humbled to be nominated. He said controversial ANC provincial executive member Andile Lili was behind the campaign for him to be the party's next president.
