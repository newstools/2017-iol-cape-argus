Raging fires, which swept through at least 20 Knysna suburbs, have killed five people in the area, including a 3-year-old and his pregnant mother. About 10 000 residents have been displaced, and about 300 structures have been totally destroyed, causing damage amounting to millions of rand. The bodies of 3-year-old Michael Johnston and his parents Tony and Madré were discovered outside their house on the farm Kalanderkloof in the Elandskraal area on Wednesday. They are believed to have been overcome by smoke, according to police. The 3-year-old had been celebrating his birthday, while his mother was eight months' pregnant. An elderly man from the Brenton area suffered a heart attack, while a 4-year-old girl from Welbedacht was found dead in a burnt-out building by her father. Late yesterday officials said the fires were still not under control.
