Cape Town - Traders on Greenmarket Square, a tourist hot spot, are upset about the state of the toilets on the square and the rubbish that s piling up. Trader Trevor Eden said the public toilets have been in a state of disrepair for the past six months. Only one was working and open until 4pm. Thereafter, those in need of the toilets are forced to do their business on the outside. This has caused traders an excessive amount of problems as potential customers race away because of the stench, he said. Here is some fine art which is hand made, but the smell just makes it unbearable to even want to have a look, said a customer.The person in charge of cleaning the toilets, who didn t want to give his name, said: The taps and other essential things are often stolen This is why we need to close the toilets early. George Muruta said the state of the area was affecting his nearby business. When we get here in the morning, it looks like a river of urine. We have to clean the mess ourselves, he said . The city said the matter would be investigated.Councillor for the area, Suzette Little, said: Unfortunately the terms of tender do not allow for the facility to be operational until 4pm over the weekends, but we are in talks with vendors to extend the working hours of staff. Ongoing repairs have been effected over the past six months. However, we are faced with daily breakages and vandalism ongoing maintenance and additional refurbishment projects are planned for the new financial year. Cape Argus
