Lions tighthead prop Ruan Dreyer has been rewarded for his outstanding Super Rugby form after he was included in the Springbok team for Saturday’s third Test against France at Ellis Park. Dreyer has been a stalwart of the Lions scrum over the last few years alongside the currently injured Julian Redelinghuys, and despite being part of a Springbok tour group previously, he has yet to wear the green-and-gold jersey. Now he will make his international bow on his home ground on Saturday, with Frans Malherbe taking a breather. Bok coach Allister Coetzee has also made three other changes, with Jesse Kriel returning from concussion to replace Lionel Mapoe at outside centre, while Francois Hougaard comes in for Ross Cronjé – who is also concussed – at scrumhalf. Sharks star Jean-Luc du Preez will make his first Test start at blindside flank following the concussion sustained by Oupa Mohoje in last week’s 37-15 win at Kings Park, which secured a 2-0 series triumph.  Fit-again loose forward Jaco Kriel is also back in the mix on the bench, and will look to make a major impact in the last quarter, while Rudy Paige takes Hougaard’s spot among the replacements. Saturday’s Test will start at 5pm.
