Cape Town The police have confirmed that missing 15-year-old Erin Fredericks has been found unharmed. &quot;Missing person found unharmed and reunited with family. Thanks to all involved,&quot; police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said. She went missing two weeks ago and was reportedly last seen at her father's house in Grassy Park. An extensive search was launched for the teen, and members of the Mitchell's Plain Crisis Forum also joined the search last week. On Tuesday, the forum hosted a prayer meeting before the search continued. Her mother, Margeret de Koker, had made a desperate plea for her safe return. &quot;I feel at this moment that if she ran away by herself because she was naughty she must please come back because we will sort out anything that's bothering her. But we first need her home. Because at this point in time it's the not knowing where your child is that is killing me,&quot; she said. The girl was en route to being reunited with her mother by late on Tuesday afternoon. Cape Argus
