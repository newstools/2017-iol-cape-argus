Beukes, who has three children (a fourth died) and 10 great-grandchildren, said the real reason for her longevity was that she never indulged in worldly things. “I just gave myself over to the Lord,” Beukes said. “I never took part in these things in the world, and I always try to do as the Lord asks - to be a friendly person, and to be a person for another person, to help everyone as much I can. I did it with pleasure.” Beukes, who was born in 1914, revealed that in her 100 years, life has changed a lot. “Life changes - the life of this world was otherwise, there is a great difference in the world of then and now but today’s life goes on, especially for the young people.” “We just went on with ourselves, with our thoughts and feelings.” Beukes also stressed that it is very important to to have respect for the next person, and in that way it is possible to live in peace and quiet with everyone. She also added that being surrounded by young people keep her young too. “In my life now I’m old, but even if I’m old like this, I can go on with technology,” she said. “I can also fit me in with these young people and talk to them - query something with them. I enjoy young people around me, and I always like to be in young people’s conversations, and it is through them also that I pick up some things.” “I appreciate the company of people because when you're old, you are just left alone.” Beukes said in her life she has learned that it is very important to treat everyone with respect. “You must be respectful for the next person, that is what it is. My friends are all over 60 years-old, they are still young. We all have the respect for each other. I admire it and I appreciate it.”
