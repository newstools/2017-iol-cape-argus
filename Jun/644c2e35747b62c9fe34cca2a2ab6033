Cape Town – The average water level for dams across the Western Cape has increased by around two percentage points on average over the past week and around four percentage points over the past two weeks. Collective dam levels stood at 79% in 2013, but on May 29, the average levels were just 17.6% across the Western Cape. The latest readings indicate the levels have increased to 21.2% on average across the Western Cape. Officials have also repeatedly warned that the last 10% of any dam’s water supply is difficult to extract. Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning MEC Anton Bredell said the Western Cape remains a drought-stricken province despite recent rainfall. "There has been a slight increase in the average dam levels but we are still a long way off from breaking this ongoing drought. "We hope to be around 75% on average by October with the eye on the coming summer period." Bredell has cautioned the public to continue to use water sparingly when it does start to rain as forecast over the next few weeks. "We must ensure that dam levels recover, so when it starts to rain, consumers should not revert back to using water wastefully." Cape Argus
