The Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University (SMU), formerly known as Medunsa, said this week that they were following up on the observations from the UKZN investigation, implicating certain individuals associated with SMU. The interim vice-chancellor, Professor Chris de Beer, commissioned this investigation. “The university will provide further information as appropriate. SMU is committed to a policy and value framework of zero tolerance for fraud and corruption,” said SMU spokesperson, Eric Pule. SMU’s investigation follows the arrests in Durban of three individuals alleged to have been selling places to study medicine and other health science courses at UKZN for a fee of up to R500 000. This included the owners of Durban’s popular Little Gujarat Restaurants, Varsha and Hiteshkumar Bhatt, and an uMhlanga businesswoman, Preshni Hiramun. The Sunday Tribune has received several tip-offs that the syndicate was operating in other universities. Meanwhile, UKZN is still appealing to anyone with information, or to students who may have bribed their way, to come forward. They have set up a toll-free fraud hotline for this purpose. All reports will be treated anonymously and in the strictest of confidence. The toll free number is 0800 20 32 85. The university’s executive management said it was concerned about its medical school’s reputation, and the negative effect that any corruption of the selection and admission processes would have on this reputation. “Additional checks and balances in our selection and admission processes led to detection of specific corrupt practices, which were then referred to the Hawks for further investigation,” Vice Chancellor Dr Albert Van Jaarsveld said.  nabeelah.shaikh@inl.co.za  Sunday Tribune
