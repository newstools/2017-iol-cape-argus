On Saturday, Dodgeball SA put on a fundraiser at the Athlone School for the Blind where 12 teams participated, including a social team where guests and spectators could join in the fun. Chantelle Lourens, one of the members of Dodgeball SA, said there were many who participated for the first time and that alone made the experience so much more fun to watch. “Some real talent arose from all the newbies that played and I didn't see one unhappy face the entire day. It was a bit wet and rainy outside, but inside the hall, it was fun, warm and sunny. “I fell in love with the sport a few months ago when I stumbled across it being played at Jump Around Trampoline park in Paardeneiland. I haven't stopped playing since. “Dodgeball is an entertaining sport as well as a fun means of getting fit without even knowing it.” Lourens said that they managed to raise R8 000, but the team needs R250 000 before August. They've managed to land a sponsor in designer sock brand Nic Harry so when they do hit the arena, they'll be doing it in SA colours.    “Besides raising funds, the aim was for people to enjoy the sport we love and get more people involved in it and trying it out. This tournament was not only aimed at raising funds but also spreading the sport and getting people that have never played it before involved.” The Dodgeball SA will have two more events at RUSH Trampoline Park in Claremont, and the team also has as a comedy show lined up.
