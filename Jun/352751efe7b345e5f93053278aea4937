Cape Town - Community Safety MEC Dan Plato has called on police to investigate every detail on the biggest drug bust in the country and urged them to ensure no one involved escapes punishment for the crime. On Wednesday, police discovered a massive cocaine haul in Villiersdorp believed, said spokesperson FC Van Wyk, to be the biggest drug bust in the country. “Police seized 253 boxes of cocaine and arrested three suspects. The drugs are estimated at R300 million and are believed to have been destined for the export market,” said Van Wyk. Three men, aged between 23 and 42, were arrested and charged with possession and drug dealing. On Thursday, Plato congratulated police, but said the operation was sophisticated and “questionably not only included three people”. It is alleged the drugs were from a Boland farm.
