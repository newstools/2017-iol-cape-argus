Sandra Swartz, 56, who has lived in their three-bedroom flat in Aspeling Court for 45 years, said she and 13 relatives were in bed when the roof lifted at 11.30pm on Tuesday, and she heard her daughter, Gracia Mostert, 33, screaming. A still-shocked Mostert, who was cradling her injured son Joden on her lap while seated in a neighbour’s flat yesterday, recounted the traumatic incident. “The asbestos part of the roof fell on us while we were in bed. It fell on me and Joden. Half of my bedroom’s roof is gone, and the lounge, bathroom and stoep roof is completely off. Joden received two lacerations on his forehead, and stitches for his wounds.” Part of the roof fell on her, but she was just slightly bruised, she added. Swartz said: “We need a safe and proper place to sleep and stay for our entire family of 14 people immediately, and we need our furniture and possessions to be taken to a safe place until the flat is fixed up.” She said this was the second time that their roof had been blown off. “The first time was about 32 years ago when Gracia was a child.” Swartz said the family had not taken note of any possible damage to their possessions as they had been in a hurry to flee the flat, but their furniture and clothes were wet. The area’s ward councillor, Marita Petersen, said she and fellow councillor Shannon Rossouw had inspected the damage and promised to find the family temporary accommodation by today. “The city will have to look at carting their possessions to a safe place,” she added.  raphael.wolf@inl.co.za
