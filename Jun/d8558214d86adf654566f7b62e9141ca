As the consequences of each new email and allegation break it is pertinent to ask the question: Where is our public protector? In the midst of this scandal, Busisiwe Mkhwebane seems to be missing in action by maintaining a strangely stoical silence. This is most odd, as chapter seven of the Public Protector Act empowers the office of the Public Protector to conduct an investigation on her own initiative. Why on earth has she not acted or announced action on even a single one of the allegations of abuse of office by a minister or public official that have emerged in recent weeks? The constitutional obligation of the public protector is precisely to investigate  any conduct in state affairs or the public administration that is “alleged or suspected to be improper, or to result in any impropriety or prejudice”. The latest scandal surely ticks all those boxes. A great deal of public scepticism heralded 
Mkhwebane's appointment to this critical post and, so far, her inaction has done nothing but prove her critics right. South Africans need a strong public protector who is going to stand up for the constitution and what is right, not a patsy who kow-tows to the executive. Its time to break your silence and get to work on this scourge, Ms Mkhwebane. South Africa is watching! John Steenhuisen MP Chief Whip of the Official Opposition Parliament of RSA
