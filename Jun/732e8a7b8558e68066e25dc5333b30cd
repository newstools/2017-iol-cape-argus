Competition Commission spokesperson Sipho Ngwema said they had received a complaint from the Robben Island Museum and conducted an investigation into the five chartering services. “The commission’s investigation found that around September 22, 2015, the respondents met at the Cape Town Fish Market Coffee Shop, where they discussed and agreed to increase the prices.” The conduct of Thembekile Maritime Services (Pty) Ltd (Thembekile); Silverbuckle Trade 21 CC t/a Yacoob Yatch (Silverbuckle); Nauticat Charters (Pty) Ltd (Nauticat Charters); Ferry Charters (Pty) Ltd (Ferry Charters); and Tigger 2 Charters (Pty) Ltd (Tigger 2 Charters) following the meeting at the coffee shop amounted to price fixing and collusive tendering in contravention of Competition Act, said Ngwema. Should the order be issued against the boat owners, they could end up paying an administrative penalty equivalent to 10% of their annual turnover. Ngwema said the investigation found that Thembekile and Nauticat Charters increased their prices to R18000 a trip for 140 passengers, while Ferry Charters did not alter their prices, as they already charged that amount. “Silverbuckle and Tigger 2 Charters also increased their prices as agreed during the coffee shop meeting, but not to the same extent as that of the other respondents as their vessels are smaller.” Most of the boat owners weren’t available for comment. One of the boat owners, who did not want to be named, said that she would not comment because the matter was still pending and the group had not been notified when the Tribunal will deliberate. Robben Island Museum could not be reached for comment.
