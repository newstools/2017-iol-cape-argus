Johannesburg - The Constitutional Court will on Thursday give judgment on whether members of Parliament can vote in secret in a no confidence vote against President Jacob Zuma. Last month, the court had reserved its judgment following various arguments made by the United Democratic Movement (UDM), civil society movements, the EFF and the Speaker of Parliament Baleka Mbete. Opposition parties had applied for a vote of confidence in Zuma, and it was scheduled for April by Mbete. However, after the UDM's attempts to ask Mbete to allow for a secret vote failed, the party turned to the highest court in the land. The scheduled vote was later cancelled in Parliament, pending the outcome of the court case. Legal representatives of the parties were grilled by ConCourt justices on the constitutional standing of a secret ballot and whether the court had the ability to compel the speak to do so. The UDM and the EFF had argued that a secret vote was the only way to ensure that ANC MPs were able to vote with their conscious, and not fall victim to party pressure. @ZintleMahlati Politics and Development Hub
