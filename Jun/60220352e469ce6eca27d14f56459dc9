President Jacob Zuma and Police Minister Fikile Mbalula recently visited Elsies River, where residents told them that there is a significant shortage of social workers. Imraahn Mukaddam said: “We don’t need more police but more social workers. It is a sad situation for Elsies River because 14 people have died here, including three-year-old Courtney Pieters. “We need more social workersto solve social matters within  communities.” Dr Shanaaz Matthews, the director of the University of Cape Town’s Children Institute, said that R238 billion is spent annually to fight violence against children in South Africa. “This is costing us as a nation. Children’s exposure from an early age to violence increases their risk to become perpetrators,” she said. Matthews said that the country’s homicide rate was double the international average. Social Development MEC Albert Fritz said: “Over the last few months we went through hell on the Cape Flats. Nineteen people were killed. “People are asking where are our social workers, but we are removing children from where there are problems in homes.” Cape Argus
