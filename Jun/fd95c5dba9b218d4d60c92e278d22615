Cape Town - A Manenberg&nbsp;teenager is on his way to achieving his dream of becoming a professional rugby player. Yazeed Karriem, 18, is set to debut at this year s Craven Week, playing flyhalf for Western Province, next month. Craven Week is an annual provincial rugby tournament organised for high school boys from across the country. It will take place at St Stithians College in Johannesburg from July 17-22. Karriem, a Grade 12 pupil at The Leadership College in Manenberg, said he heard about his selection from his father. I feel very honoured and excited about this. To me, it is like a motivation to other children who are also from previously disadvantaged communities, Karriem said.&nbsp; It shows that a coloured child like me from Manenberg can make something out of his life.&nbsp; I always tell people that great things never come out from comfort zones, you need to get out and experience things you are not used to at times. He started playing rugby from the age of five. I was sitting with a ball and a man approached me and asked me who my dad was. When I told him my father s name, he said I am playing a rugby game that night.&nbsp; I was shocked but excited and called my dad to buy me shorts for the game. It was on that night Karriem s &nbsp;passion for the game developed, when he played for &nbsp;Manenberg Rangers against Primrose.&nbsp; He still plays for Rangers.Karriem earned his WP call-up after recently participating at trials for the Craven Week squad. He said his selection is the first stepping stone in his journey to playing professionally, and possibly representing Super Rugby franchise, the Stormers. I am a big Stormers supporter. I would love to one day make it to playing for that team, Karriem added. [email&#160;protected] Cape Argus&nbsp;
