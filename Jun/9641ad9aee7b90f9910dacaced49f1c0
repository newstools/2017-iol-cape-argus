Cape Town – Fed up parents of Sunnyside Primary School have had enough. The school, badly damaged by the storm that lashed the Cape, hosted a mass meeting on Tuesday night where the school's governing body, circuit manager and the parents of pupils could engage each other. Parents were not afraid to voice their concerns regarding the school's current state. The meeting comes a week after a devastating storm left the school in tatters forcing 600 learners to stay at home. The Western Cape Education Department deployed four mobile classrooms to accommodate the pupils, but parents said this was not enough. "I understand all of us here are upset regarding the current state of the school. But we have to work together to make progress," acting principal Nathaniel Brache said. Last week the Cape Argus reported that the school was damaged so severely it was deemed unsafe. On Tuesday night, parents shared just how cautious they were about sending their children to school at Sunnyside.
