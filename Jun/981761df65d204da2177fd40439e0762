At a breakfast held at the Lentegeur Administration Building yesterday that marked the beginning of Youth Month commemorations, a candle was lit in memory of those who have fallen prey to abuse, rape, robberies and those who have been killed. Strandfontein Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Sandy Schuter said the event was an opportunity to highlight the work that civil society was doing to keep communities safe. She said community policing fulfilled the role law enforcement agencies weren't able to and were the eyes and ears on the ground. “We are extremely passionate about bus stop patrols. We mobilise communities to stand closely together. Usually, people standing apart actually makes them victims to preying criminals. We start from as early as 4am. We switch from various hotspots with Strandfontein police. We can’t predict what our day is going to be like. “We also do victim support counselling whether it is abuse, rape or murder. We have afternoon patrols focusing on children coming from school. “Our mandate is to build relations between police and the community to instil trust between these various safety parties,” said Schuter. Ward councillor Elton Jansen said: “We acknowledge the important role women play in society with regards to developing our communities. These are women who tirelessly patrol in the mornings and late at night and this event is a token of our appreciation and thanking them for the role they play”. Social Development MEC Albert Fritz, who attended the event, urged people to play an active role in protecting women and children. “We can stop the violence and murder of children and youth if we all play a part in creating the sort of stable, loving and caring family spaces which are so sorely needed in communities”, said Fritz. “It is going to take the whole of society's efforts to combat violence against women and children,” he added.
