Cape Town – A 35-year-old male suspect has been arrested for the murder of little Minentle Lekhatha. Minentle, 5, from Nomzamo, Strand, was last seen playing alone outside her house on Saturday and her lifeless body was discovered a day later, hidden under a bridge not far from her home. "Our prioritised around-the-clock investigation into the brutal murder of Minentle Lekhata on Sunday in Lwandle led a group of detectives to a 35-year-old suspect from the same area earlier (on Wednesday)," police spokesperson Andre Traut said. "He was arrested on a charge of murder and is expected to make a court appearance in Strand on Thursday 8 June 2017. Our investigation into the circumstances surrounding the case is yet to be finalised and the finer aspects of the suspect’s apprehension cannot be disclosed at this stage. "The safety of children is a top priority for the Western Cape police and we will make every endeavor to ensure that offenders are brought to book to face the full consequences of their ruthless deeds," Traut said.
