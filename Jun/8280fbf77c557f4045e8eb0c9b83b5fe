Cape Town â€“ Well-known Cape Town runner Nezaam Isaacs, 42, was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Claremont, in the southern suburbs of Cape Town, early on Tuesday morning. Cape Town Traffic spokesperson Richard Coleman said Belvedere Road was closed and traffic diverted after the fatal accident. Isaacs, who was part of the Itheko running club, was doing his morning run when he was knocked down. Sniper Security Services director Ridwaan Mathews confirmed that Isaacs was knocked over just after 4am. "Our team was patrolling the area at about 4:30 when they came across the runner who was knocked down. By that time there were already about two bystanders on the scene and our team spoke to the eyewitnesses," Mathews said. The eyewitnesses shared the number plate of a silver Volkswagen GTi vehicle. He confirms the information was shared with the police and they are currently searching for the driver of the vehicle. Within minutes, the team of security services sent out the information via social media, Mathews said. "We got confirmation within minutes of who the runner was and in which running club he competes. We understand Isaacs was an avid runner with a huge amount of experience," Mathews said. The news of Isaacs's death has devastated his close friend and chairman of the Itheko running club Ashraf Orrie. "I was the first on the scene. I think he suffered from a huge gash on his face," Orrie said. Orrie said that Isaacs was known for being a extremely straight to the point person. "He was a very nice person, very straight forward." Orrie said. Police spokesperson Andre Traut confirmed his death. "(We) can confirm the death of a man is being investigated after he was hit by a vehicle while jogging in Belvedere Road, Claremont," Traut says. Traut says a culpable homicide case has been registered and any person with information regarding the incident is urged to contact Michael Benn on 082 469 2525.
