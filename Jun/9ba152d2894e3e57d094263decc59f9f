Cape Town – A fourth suspect in the murder of 21-year-old Stellenbosch University student Hannah Cornelius appeared in court on Wednesday. Eben van Niekerk, 27, appeared in the Stellenbosch Magistrate's Court in connection with her murder. The other suspects – Vernon Witbooi, 32), Geraldo Parsons, 26, and Nashwill Julies, 26 – are due back in court on July 28. Around 250 students marched against crime in the area on Wednesday. After the march, the students handed over a memorandum to the management of Stellenbosch University (SU). Student activist, Luke Waltham, said they are disgusted and worried by the high levels of crime, especially on and around the campus. "We don't want to live in fear and worry about our safety. In Stellenbosch our students are at a major risk of being hijacked, stabbed, robbed and killed within the proximity of the university. "We will have to improve the efficiency of the security services by improving the time securities get to students who may be in danger," Waltham said. University spokesperson Martin Viljoen said the institution was refining its safety and security on campus. "It will be on and around campus," Viljoen said. Cape Argus
