Cape Town – While preparing for his Father's Day sermon, local pastor and gospel singer Wilmot Fredericks heard the gunshots that killed his son. Wilton Fredericks, his brother Byron Levi Fredericks and their father Wilmot Fredericks were due to perform together at a Goodwood church on Sunday where Wilmot's sermon was to be about the father-son relationship. Wilton was gunned down outside his Nooitgedacht, Bishop Lavis, home on Saturday. Two other men were also killed in the incident. "Three victims were shot while standing outside the address," police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said. "Two died on the scene while the third victim died in hospital. "Circumstances surrounding death of three men is under investigation," she said. "I knew my son was out there," Wilmot told the Cape Argus. "I had left him standing with a group of his childhood friends. I ran out towards the scene only to find that people were going in the opposite direction. "I found my son lying there. To me it seemed it wasn’t a serious wound, but as I was encouraging him to remain conscious I could see he was struggling to breathe. He told me: ‘Ek kannie’ (I can't)." Within minutes, paramedics arrived to transport Wilton to the Elsies River Day Hospital where he later died. The Fredericks family is known for their talent in gospel music. Wilton was described as the "real singer" in the family. "He was never in trouble with police, he has never been arrested," Wilmot said. "He was standing at that place like I would; speaking to people he grew up with. "He was at the wrong place at the wrong time. It could’ve been me because it is in my nature to laugh and speak to everyone."  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
