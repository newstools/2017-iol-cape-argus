Cape Town – Aunt Dora le Roux from Strandfontein, celebrated her 104th birthday on Tuesday and was all smiles at her party. Though she may not be able to remember everything about the life she has lived, Aunt Dora still enjoyed herself and smiled throughout the celebration of her life. She lives at the Cape Peninsula Organisation for the Aged home in Athlone and arrived there when she turned 99. “Mommy was very strict and she always stressed the importance of education when we grew up,” Dephney van Ster, one of her daughters, said. Although she is the oldest at the home, she is still active. No wonder, as she kept an active life throughout her years. She played provincial table tennis and has had few health problems. “Looking after Mrs Le Roux has not been a difficult job. Honestly, it has only been a pleasure, honour and a blessing,” Margaret Brinkhuys from the home said. Aunt Dora said she was always an active Christian and credits her faith for her longevity. She raised her four children in a strict Christian home and as a result, both of her sons are now pastors. Vangate Mall's Pick n Pay manager Yoliswa Nthanka was present at the celebration to hand over her birthday cake. Her loved ones, staff and all the residents of the home sang her happy birthday. “My secret to a long and healthy life has been trusting and believing in the Lord and obeying my parents,” Le Roux said as she giggled.
