Bulelwa Lobi, 35, from Lwandle in Strand, was at home with her two children aged 2 and 11 about 7pm on Monday when the men entered her house. According to ward councillor Jongidumo Maxheke, the men then asked Lobi for her cellphone and wallet. “They said the money was not enough, and in fear of getting killed, Lobi offered the suspects R2 000, which she sent her 11-year-old child to collect." “After the two suspects received the money, they shot Bulelwa. One of her children rushed off to neighbours for help, but it was too late. It was said by the neighbours that they were unable to hear the gunshots because of the rain." Police spokersperson Noloyiso Rwexana confirmed the incident. “The suspect shot the victim in her head and face, and she died of her injuries. No one has been arrested at this stage. Anyone with information that can assist with the investigation is requested to contact the investigating officer, Detective Warrant Officer Randall van Skalkwyk on 021 845 2060 or 082 522 1208.” Lobi's sister Thabisa said she could not believe what had happened. She also said that the family were fearing for their lives. Thabisa said her sister's eldest child, 17, was not coping as he has not eaten since the incident. “My sister was a lovely person, who would always bring joy with her as she entered a room." "It feels like she is about to walk through the door right now, as usual.” Maxheke expressed outrage, condemning the murder. “This is a very serious incident. The abuse of women and children happens far too often in this area." "It is time for the community to come together and fight against what is happening”, he said. Cape Argus
