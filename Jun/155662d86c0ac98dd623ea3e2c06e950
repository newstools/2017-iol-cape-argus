Cape Town – The man accused of murdering 5-year-old Minentle Lekhatha has appeared in the Strand Magistrate’s Court. Xolani Lantu, 35, made a brief appearance before the case was postponed to August 3. Lantu, who was also charged with kidnapping and rape, sat in the dock with his faced covered by the raincoat he was wearing. He kept his head down throughout his appearance. Supporters of the family filled court A staring at the accused. Others outside held placards that read “enough is enough”. There was also large police presence in and outside the courtroom.
