Cape Town – Police say there is progress being made in the case involving the discovery of the bodies of a mother and child in Atlantis. The bodies of Octavia Bruan, 24, and her two-year-old toddler were discovered hidden in bushes in the town on Tuesday. "The circumstances surrounding the double murder are still under investigation, and although progress is being made, no one has been arrested as yet," police spokesperson Andre Traut said. The heads of both the victims were buried in the sand with their bodies lying exposed. It looked all too familiar to Atlantis residents, who, in 2012, came across the decomposed bodies of Mashay Louw, 18, and her daughter, Tatum, 1, also hidden in a bushy area. The Atlantis community is outraged at the latest attack. "We are up in arms at this point. We’ve seen horrible killings of women and children and we want this to end," community activist Allister Lightburn said. He said the police have been handling the latest case with caution. "I am aware that they took Bruan’s boyfriend in for questioning but because his alibi was credible he was let go." Lightburn said drugs were also discovered on the scene. "The bodies were found in the early hours of the morning and the person who found the bodies is now a suspect, I know." Bruan and her little girl were last seen going to the hairdresser over the weekend. Additional reporting: Okuhle Hlati and Robin Lee Francke  marvin.charles@inl.co.za
