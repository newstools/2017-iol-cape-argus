Cape Town An education activist has urged the the Department of Basic Education to do away with Life Orientation as a subject in schools, as it does not add any value to the academic development of pupils.Hendrick Makaneta believes that Life Orientation should be left to the Department of Social Development, churches and civic organisations. Life Orientation is a serious waste of time for our students, because in universities it is not recognised.&quot;He said learners should be encouraged to do maths as the country faces a subject crisis with not enough pupils passing maths. Schools had to focus on the core business of teaching the curriculum which would take pupils to greater heights, said Makaneta. Now that we have defeated Bantu Education, it is now time to scrap Life Orientation and make History and Mathematics compulsory for all schools.&quot;His call has been supported by Wits Life Orientation and Religious Studies Professor Rene Ferguson.
