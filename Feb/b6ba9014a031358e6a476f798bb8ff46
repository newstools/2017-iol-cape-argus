Cape Town After months of not having their rubbish collected, residents of Europe informal settlement in Gugulethu say they are fed up with living in rodent infested conditions.The problem started after a new councillor was elected last year who removed people hired to collect rubbish, SA National Civics Organisation, member Zilindile Gcobo said. The councillor moved them because he said they were not on the database. Hundreds of people are suffering from different diseases and illnesses. And because of the bad smell, fleas and maggots are coming out of the rubbish container, he said.Resident Altexre Zagana, 76, said: This situation we are living in is nothing but death, people have been admitted to hospitals. Nomzamo Mavalantiya, 45, who is selling braai meat in the community said she has been living in the area for 15 years but it s her first time to experience this problem.Bongani Ngcombolo, who is the Ward 40 councillor, said rubbish was collected last month. The area was cleaned in January, where we had municipal trucks that came and cleaned the area, said Ngcombolo.The City confirmed that it is aware of the issue in Europe and is in the process of communicating with the community.
