Cape Town - Police watchdog, the Independent Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has recommended prosecution of some of the police officers involved in the killing of a Nando s staffer. This after the directorate concluded its investigation into the killing of Dunoon resident Pumeza Fudumele. Her colleague was wounded during the incident. They were on their way home after working the late shift in Parklands, when their staff vehicle came under fire in Dunoon. At the time, the Ipid said the vehicle Fudumele and her colleagues were travelling in matched the description of a car identified as being involved in an alleged ATM bombing. The police officers received a call that an ATM had been bombed in the Dunoon/Milnerton area. But when they arrived at the scene, they found nothing. Friday marked one year since the mother of two was killed. Fudumele s mother, Thozama, said her daughter s death has left a gaping hole in her family. Ipid spokesperson Moses Dlamini this week told the Cape Times that the watchdog had further made recommendations to the SAPS for disciplinary action against some of its members, but the outcome of that was still outstanding. Police spokesperson Novela Potelwa said police management had not yet received Ipid s recommendations.National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Eric Ntabazalila said: Ipid first referred the docket to the NPA for a decision on August 1, 2016. The investigation was incomplete. The NPA and Ipid have been collaborating since then with a view to Ipid completing the investigation. The NPA received the docket last on January 20, 2017. Cape Argus
