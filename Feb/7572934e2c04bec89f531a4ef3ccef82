Cape Town Drakenstein prison officials downed tools on Tuesday in protest against their area commissioner, who they allege is racist.The officials claim an area commissioner discriminates against black staff.Luyanda Ngalo said he showed favouritism towards coloured employees. He labels us as being lazy, saying we don t want to do anything but sit around. Even when a prisoner escaped this year, he blamed black officials for helping the prisoner escape, said Ngalo.Some officials who share Ngalo s sentiments do not wish to be named, fearing victimisation. They also protested along with the group and said they were overlooked for promotion because of the colour of their skin. Mncedisi Mbolekwa, the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (Popcru) provincial secretary, said they had complained about the area commissioner before. Enough is enough, that is why the members decided to down tools. They want him removed and placed somewhere until an investigation is started and completed, because he will interfere, said Mbolekwa.Correctional Services regional commissioner Dalekile Klaas said allegations had been made against the area boss in November last year.He said the department had told the protesting officials that an investigator would be appointed. What happened (yesterday) was unfortunate and it was an illegal strike that should not have happened, he said.Klaas said they would not comment on the allegations levelled against the area commissioner, but would try to resolve the matter. The Cape Argus made several attempts to contact the area commissioner but he could not be reached.Cape Argus
