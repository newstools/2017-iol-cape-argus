Cape Town - Children from disadvantaged backgrounds in Kayamandi, Stellenbosch, have found hope with an organisation that seeks to better their lives. Songo.info, which was established in 2008 by five-time Cape Epic winner Christoph Sauser, trains about 50 children and young adults, while also teaching them life skills.The 50, who are aged between 5 and 25, visit the centre every Monday to Thursday to learn how to cycle and also get assistance with their homework. On Fridays, they get an opportunity to find new and creative ways in which they can give back to the community.Garnett Khabaseli, 11, joined the organisation in 2014 and has since gained valuable life skills and has had major improvements in his academic work. The tutors at the centre have helped me better my marks and coming to the centre has also given me confidence in my everyday life. Sauser said that one of the major keys to the centre s success was helping the youngsters realise their dreams through education and cycling. Kids have a lack of connections and opportunities, so here at Songo, we try to help them as best as we can so that they have clearer future goals, Sauser said.Theo Ngubane, 21, who joined the organisation four years ago, will be participating in his first Cape Epic race next month. I came here as a young boy who did not know what I wanted to do in life. Through Songo I managed to find my purpose in life because the people here have changed my life for the better and they have become family, he added. Cape Argus
