Police are investigating the fatal shooting of two young men in Lower Crossroads on Tuesday, which also left three other young men injured. It is alleged that last night (Tuesday) at about 9pm five young men were sitting watching television at a house in Nondlwane Road, when unidentified men came inside the house and fired several shots at them, police spokesperson FC van Wyk said. Two victims aged 19 and 23 died on the scene due to injuries sustained and three other victims were rushed to a nearby hospital for medical treatment. &quot;The motive is unknown at this stage. Cases (of) murder and attempted murder are being investigated. The owner of the home the men were in, Nomfundiso Danphile, 34, said they were watching soccer when the gunmen attacked them. We were sitting in my shack, watching soccer. The other two guys went outside, five minutes after they were outside, we heard two gunshots and they ran back to the shack. We all ran to a room to hide and I was confused because I didn t know what was happening. My 4-year-old and 11-year-old children are now traumatised because the shooting happened right in front of them. Ward councillor Mboniswa Chitha said it had been a while since an incident like that had happened in their community. We last had a similar incident last year, where a family was attacked inside their house, that s exactly what happened to these young men who were sitting at home watching TV. Cape Argus
