Picture: Henk Kruger/Cape Argus The future looks brighter for me now. At a young age I never thought this would happen, said Tylor, adding that he was grateful for his parents support. He advised families in similar situations to not give up hope. For a family like us that have gone through this, parents should never expect too little from them. People like us have the ability to do anything we want, Tylor said.He also thanked his sister, Ha-Lee, who he described as someone he could talk to in times of need. She would give me the confidence to tell my parents to say what s happening, Tylor said.Ha-Lee also helped teach him to speak when they were younger. Their mother said that when Tylor didn t want to interact with a speech therapist, Ha-Lee would play games with him to help him articulate words.Tylor's father, Nehemia Doolabh, said he always drew strength from the person his son became. I can very proudly say that this young man standing here next to me is my hero, Nehemia said. Cape Argus
