The exercise is conducted every second year in line with South African aviation legislation as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organisation. Numerous role-players took part in the drill, which did not affect the normal operations of the airport. Included in the exercise were the National Sea Rescue Institute, Maritime Search and Rescue, the city s Disaster Risk Management and Fire and Rescue Services, the army, emergency medical services, the police and traffic services.
