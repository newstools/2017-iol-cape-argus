Cape Town A handful of families have been left destitute after their homes in Overcome Heights, near Capricorn in Muizenberg, were demolished by the anti-land invasion unit on Sunday.The residents told the Cape Argus that they got permission to settle on the land from ward councillor Gerry Gordon.However, Gordon denies that permission was granted for them to build four informal structures near the toilets in the Overcome Heights community. Initially they asked me if they can erect two shacks on that field near the toilets.&quot; They then asked for four shacks to be built and I said no . Because the city has a process, Gordon said. There are about 5 000 structures in Overcome Heights and the area is serviced by 25 toilets. The residents who had settled on the land close to the toilets said they had done so due to concerns that the sewage infrastructure would be stolen or vandalised as it had been in the past. We ve been asking every time and she says she will get to it, resident Zoliswa Qoma said about the theft of the piping. There was a problem with the drains and we informed her (Gordon) about it and she said there was nothing she can do because its a private contractor.&quot; We have children and babies all we are asking for is proper sanitation. Nomaxabise Dlongwana, also a resident, said she was fed up with Gordon. Every year we vote but nothing happens. But Gordon said the land where the structures were demolished was not suitable to settle on. In the first place, they occupied that land illegally.&quot; That entire area is not a liveable area. You are not supposed to stay there. Cape Argus</b>
