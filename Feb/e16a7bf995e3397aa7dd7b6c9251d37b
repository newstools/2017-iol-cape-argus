Cape Town Pregnancy education has became one of the main priorities for the provincial departments of health and education, in light of the number of cases of teenage pregnancies in schools across the Western Cape. Representatives from the departments visited two high schools in Gugulethu this week to educate pupils about teenage pregnancy and the risks of HIV/Aids. The visit was aimed at creating awareness regarding teenage pregnancies, which has become prevalent in this community and many others, said Zimkhitha Mquteni, the spokesperson for Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo.The awareness campaign about the dangers of premature sex will be taken to 50 other schools and 10000 pupils across the province. The Western Cape Education Department's Managing Learner Pregnancy in Public Schools policy is a tool that provides step-by-step guidelines to prepare teachers on how to support pregnant pupils. Jessica Shelver, the spokesperson for Education MEC Debbie Sch&auml;fer, said: The aim of the policy is to ensure that pregnant pupils stay at school and complete their schooling.&quot; The policy recognises that all concerned have roles and responsibilities in this situation, including the school, and the parents of the unborn child. Pupil pregnancy rates had decreased from 2880 in 2015 to 2412 last year, and the provincial government aims to cut that by another 5% this year. Two programmes have been developed, with the main focus being on pupils remaining in school and completing their studies after they have given birth. Mbombo said more than 2 000 girls as young as 10 are infected with HIV every week, highlighting the importance of the campaign.Cape Argus
