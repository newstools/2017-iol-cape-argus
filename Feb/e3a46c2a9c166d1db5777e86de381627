Cape Town Becoming a paramedic is a longer and more arduous task after the signing of new regulations by Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi.The regulations aim to improve the level of administrative training and to bring the accreditation in line with the National Qualifications Framework. The change was driven by the Health Professions Council of South Africa. Instead of the six-week basic life-support paramedic training, six-month intermediate life-support paramedic training and nine-month advanced life-support paramedic training courses and on-the job experience, prospective paramedics now have to complete a two-year course, with those wanting to become advanced life-support paramedics needing a four-year degree.It is believed that the new regulations will make it harder for those who cannot afford full-time university study to become paramedics.Dr Shaheem de Vries, head of Western Cape Government Health Emergency Medical Services, said while the debate isn t new, it does bring in unexpected complications for the emergency services industry. There is a lot of emotion connected with this particular question and it has been coming for quite some time.&quot;&quot;It's not something that has been sprung on the industry. We have been dealing with this issue for 20 years.&quot; Professionally it is to move forward.&quot;&quot;We don t wish to undermine the excellent work done by those involved in the short-course training, but there are shortfalls and we cannot be blind to them.&quot; What we re questioning is not the technical skill of the paramedics or their clinical acumen, but what is at play here is the broader contextual knowledge that needs to go with that.&quot; If you are look at what the problem across the country in EMS is, is a lack of leadership, not clinical leadership but managerial and administrative leadership.&quot;He also said restructuring added another level of professionalism to the industry. Until paramedics join the ranks of doctors, nurses and other health professionals.&quot;Cape Argus
