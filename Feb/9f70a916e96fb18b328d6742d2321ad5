Cape Town ANC National Executive Committee member Fikile Mbalula has called for a show of force by party members when President Zuma delivers his State of the Nation Address (Sona) on Thursday.Mbalula, who was in Cape Town on Sunday to campaign for the first People s Assembly this week, said ANC members had to come out in numbers to support Zuma.Zuma will deliver his Sona before proceeding to the Grand Parade to greet thousands of ANC supporters on Thursday. Top ANC leaders are in the Western Cape to drum up support ahead of the Sona.On Monday night ANC deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa and chairperson Baleka Mbete will address business owners in the run up to the event. Mbalula was at the Kosovo informal settlement in Philippi and Du Noon on Sunday to encourage supporters to come in their numbers.He said they are expecting over 30 000 people to gather in the city centre to watch Zuma give his speech.Although Zuma wouldn t be making a second speech at the Grand Parade, Mbalula said, his presence would serve as a show of thanks to those who came out to support him.Talking to about 100 ANC supporters in Kosovo on Sunday, Mbalula said: On Thursday when the president speaks to us, he is giving us hope, hope that in the coming years we are going to improve the lives of our people. Speaking on the Public Protector s preliminary report that suggests ABSA may have to pay back over R2 billion to the state coffers following a bailout on Bankorp, Mbalula said that money could be used to better the lives of the poor. The revolution of today is about economic freedom. Our political freedom we have won, but we must know that here in the Western Cape we are not free. &quot;We must work and work to ensure that the Western Cape is in the hands of the majority, Mbalula added.Cape Argus
