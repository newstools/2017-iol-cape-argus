Cape Town Ensuring that no child goes to bed on an empty stomach is just one of many community outreach programmes of the Juvie Boys Entertainers (JBE) minstrel group and winners of this year's Cape Town Minstrel Carnival Association competition.JBE came about after board members of the Juventus Boys Soccer Club noticed an increase in gang violence and drug abuse in Mitchells Plain during the off-season.This year the group attained its biggest achievement when it won the Carnival Kings title in its fifth year.JBE co-founder Yusuf Gester said the group had more than 800 members. It hosted a variety of programmes throughout the year, including music at schools, feeding programmes, elderly awareness and drug awareness. The community is our biggest supporter, which is why we feel there is a constant need to give back, Gester said. The choir and band practise at different schools and during the Sunday practise a lot of people, young and old, come with their picnic baskets and watch. We use that opportunity to hold talks and tell our stories while trying to raise awareness on drugs and substance abuse. During the festive season the JBE hosted an annual lunch for the elderly, and in the month of Ramadaan it visited communities in Mitchells Plain to serve meals. We first find out where the biggest need is and we take it from there. We want to ensure that no child goes to bed hungry, Gester said. Cape Argus
