I told my fellow community leaders to call the father because the boy looked familiar. That unfinished structure is very problematic and very dangerous; a girl was once raped at that very same place. Mzinyathi added that community members had been complaining about the unfinished structure for a while, saying drug users were a threat to their safety and lives. We are scared and we have tried to chase the kids away, but they pay us no attention at all. We are saddened at the passing of the boy and scared that he may not be the last one. Anyone with information relating to this case is requested to contact the investigating officer, Detective Warrant Officer AJ Petersen, on 0718916513.
