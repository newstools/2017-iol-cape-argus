The eatery calls itself a baconporium for a reason, and after visiting, it’s easy to understand why - they really love bacon. One of its charming qualities is the cheeky menu with its fun pop culture references. Each meal on the menu is given an appropriate name capturing its essence. The breakfast menu includes such options as The Breakfast Club - “Does Barry Manilow know you borrow his clothes?” - and BoB the Builder - “DIY for Hipsters”. BoB's sandwiches will also make you laugh, with names like The Anti Hero - "Bask in nostalgia" - and The Harvey Specter - “It's not bragging if it’s true”. As great as the names of the meals are, the food itself is delectable. The BLT - "You had me at Bacon" - consists of ciabatta French toast, bacon, rocket, tomato and home-made "baconnaise", and was delicious, their portions well-matched to the price that you’re paying. Whether you're going with friends and family or by yourself, Bacon on Bree has a relaxing atmosphere, and is an enjoyable place to grab a meal. While catering to bacon lovers, they also offer a "Bowl of Bacon" as a meal choice and a dessert which includes bacon. While the idea of ice cream and bacon may sound preposterous, it is more enjoyable than one would think, the bacon pieces having a similar crunch to small pieces of rusk. Bacon on Bree offers far more than just a bacon sandwich, and is worth the trip. Open from Monday to Friday from 7am to 5pm and Saturdays from 8am to 2pm. Cape Argus
