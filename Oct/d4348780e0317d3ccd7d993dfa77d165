Cape Town - The Cape Peninsula University of Technology has suspended its bus service until further notice after one of its buses was torched on Monday morning. No injuries were reported. CPUT posted about the incident and the suspension of service on its Facebook page. "The campus bus service has been suspended until further notice due to the most recent attack on one of their vehicles.Thank you," the post read. The university has been in turmoil over the last few weeks after a group of students threatened to shut the university down on Monday.   Rumours and anonymous posting had been circulating claiming that a shutdown was looming. CPUT last week beefed up security at its campuses, which had been the scene of several protests. The university denied that a shutdown was on the cards, however. "The institution remains open and operational across campuses and once again staff and students are urged to make use of the secure parking at the stadium at Bellville campus," CPUT said in a separate Facebook post. "Stoning staff and student vehicles is a cowardly tactic used by anonymous protesters to intimidate the greater CPUT community. Private security are effectively maintaining order across campuses, apart from a few isolated incidents, and will remain on campus until calm is restored and the vicious arson attacks stop."  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
