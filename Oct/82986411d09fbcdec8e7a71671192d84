Sue Barnes founded Project Dignity to help girls stay in class during their period, and now the re-usable Subz Pads she developed, designed and manufactured will be available in stores for the first time. The pads are made of five layers of specialised fabric. Barnes said missing out on school "has a profoundly negative impact on education for young women". "Subz Pants and Pads were developed as a re-usable option with a three to five-year lifespan. The launch of the CSI branch of Subz, Project Dignity, has through sponsorship seen the donation of these products to numerous schools in underprivileged communities across the country.” Barnes said she was excited to be providing the public with a green (environmentally friendly) and affordable sanitary option. She received help from the Helping Hands Trust, Clicks' NGO, and the pads are available at Clicks stores. “Customers will be able to purchase a Subz sanitary pad, which clips back onto itself around any panty. The pad is designed with one black side, with customers given the option of a range of colours for the remaining side.” Clicks' CSI manager, Germinah Nyikana, said they recently launched the Girls on the Go sanitary pad initiative in 280 Clicks stores. “We are appealing to the public to support this campaign, which enables South Africa’s girl learners to get the education they deserve and encourages them to love and respect themselves and their bodies.” She added that the Helping Hands Trust would donate one sanitary towel to the campaign for every re-usable sanitary towel bought. “Customers will also be given the option of purchasing a Subz sanitary towel to donate directly towards the Girls on the Go campaign at select Clicks tillpoints.”  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
