The NAM, formerly the Institute of Medicine, was established in 1970 under the charter of the National Academy of Sciences to advise on medical and health issues. Mayosi was one of 70 regular and 10 international members elected during the NAM’s annual meeting on Monday. Election to the academy is considered one of the highest honours in the fields of health and medicine, and recognises individuals who have demonstrated outstanding professional achievement and commitment to service. Reacting, he said: “I feel honoured to be elected as an international member of the National Academy of Medicine of the United States. Membership of the NAM reflects the height of professional achievement and commitment to service. “I am indebted to my mentors, my students, my collaborators, and above all my wife and children who have supported and inspired me over the years.” NAM members elect new members from among candidates nominated for their accomplishments and contributions to the advancement of the medical sciences, healthcare and public health. The newly elected members raise the NAM’s total active membership to 2 127 and the number of international members to 172. NAM president Victor J Dzau said: “These newly elected members represent the most exceptional scholars and leaders in science, medicine and health in the US and around the globe. “Their expertise will help our organisation address today’s most pressing health challenges and inform the future of health and healthcare to benefit us all. I am honoured to welcome these distinguished individuals to the National Academy of Medicine.” With their election, members make a commitment to volunteer their services to the NAMs aspiration to encourage education and research, to recognise outstanding contributions to knowledge, and to increase public understanding.
