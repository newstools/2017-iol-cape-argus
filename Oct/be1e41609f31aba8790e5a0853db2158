This and other information on the department’s annual report for the 2016/17 financial year were discussed in the Western Cape Legislature. The department achieved most of its targets and had a relatively small under spend, but challenges were highlighted. Over R194million was spent on goods and services for the year under review, the report said. The largest amounts were paid for property (R45m), fleet services (R19m) and agency, support and outsourced services (R82m). Chief financial officer Juan Smith said the monies spent on tea, coffee and other refreshments were classified under entertainment. “Tea, coffee and other refreshments for top managers’ and MEC’s engagements with outside stakeholders came to about R2000 per official.” Asked about the catering, he said: “At times we have social interventions and public meetings with communities. We provide food to the people,not a plate of food, but general refreshments.” The department also spent R652m on venues and facilities for workshops and community meetings. Albert Fritz, MEC for social development, said the department spent 99.8% of its budget, and obtained a clean audit, for the fourth year in a row. “Our audit results should be read in the context of tough times, and fiscal constraints.” The department transferred more than R1 billion to over 2000 NGOs; doubled the number of social workers in the past five years;  expanded substance abuse services to 36 NGOs and set up an Inspectorate to deal with abuse of older persons. Dr Robert MacDonald said child protection was the top priority.  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
