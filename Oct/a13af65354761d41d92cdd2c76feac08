He kept busy by writing and has just released his first book titled Blameless. Salie is one of four brothers and has a passion for reading and writing. “The book is about a character whose mind is controlled,” Salie explains. The book is a thriller and revolves around the main character, Tyler Reese, and portrays how easily the mind can be deceived. “I started writing the book a little over a year ago,” he said. The book is inspired by R.L Stine’s iconic horror fiction series Goosebumps. “R.L Stine’s books inspired me a lot while writing this book. I have read all of the Goosebumps books,” Salie said. Due to medical complications, Salie  was forced to be home-schooled. Despite this, he has already won numerous awards. Salie holds a certificate in Coding and Programming, a certificate in Minecraft coding and a certificate in cyber security. His favourite subjects are mathematics and science. “I love writing. I love the fact that I am able to be creative and free,” he said. Salie said his mother couldn’t be more proud. “My mother played a huge role and helped me a lot while writing this book. She really pushed me to publish this book,” he said. His mother Maryam had a special message for him when the Cape Argus spoke to her. “To Amr, may you soar higher than the eagles above. I can’t wait to see what you do next,” she said. She also added that Salie’s cousins are very happy for him. “He has a lot of cousins so they are so excited for him,” she said. The launch of Salie’s new book took place over the weekend in Lansdowne library. The book is also available at the library at R80 and it can be purchased on Amazon.com at $3.65. @MarvinCharles17  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
