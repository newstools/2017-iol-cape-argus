Cape Town - President Jacob Zuma has shuffled his Cabinet seven times since his inauguration in 2009, twice in 2017 alone. Without counting his inauguration for his second term in offce and subsequent Cabinet appointments in 2014, this leaves six times Zuma has shuffled members of his executive around, often with detrimental consequences for the economy and international investor sentiment. Up until Tuesday, only seven Cabinet ministers retained their posts since 2009 - Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform Gugile Nkwinti, Minister of Health Aaron Motsoaledi, Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Maite Nkoana-Mashabane, Minister of Trade and Industry Rob Davies, Minister of Economic Development Ebrahim Patel, Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga, and Minister of Higher Education Blade Nzimande. With Nzimande now the erstwhile Higher Education Minister, this leaves just six minister who are still serving in the same portfolio since they were appointed in 2009. After his inauguration in 2009, Zuma reshuffled his Cabinet the very next year in 2010. * Zuma fired Barbara Hogan as Public Enterprises Minister, replacing her with Malusi Gigaba * He replaced Noluthando Mayende-Sibiya with Lulu Xingwana as Minister of Women, Youth, Children and People with Disabilities * Paul Mashatile replaced Xingwana as Minister of Arts and Culture * Edna Molewa replaced Buyelwa Sonjica as Minister of Water and Environmental Affairs * Minister of Sport and Recreation Makhenkesi Stofile was replaced by Fikile Mbalula * Edna Molewa was replaced as Minister of Social Development by Bathabile Dlamini * Geoff Doidge was replaced by Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde as Minister of Public Works * Mildred Oliphant took Membathisi Mdladlana place as Minister of Labour * Minister of Communications Siphiwe Nyanda was replaced by Roy Padayachie A year later, in 2011, Zuma shuffled his Cabinet again. * Minister of Communications Roy Padayachie was replaced by Dina Pule * Padayachie replaced Richard Baloyi as Minister of Public Service and Administration * Baloyi replaced Sicelo Shiceka as Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs * Thulas Nxesi replaced Gwen Mahlangu-Nkabinde as Minister of Public Works In 2013, Zuma did it again. * Yunus Carrim became Minister of Communications after Dina Pule * Lechesa Tsenoli replaced Richard Baloyi as Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs * S'bu Ndebele took over from Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula as Minister of Correctional Services * Mapisa-Nqakula was moved to Minister of Defence and Military Veterans too take over from Lindiwe Sisulu * Sisulu took over as Minister of Public Service and Administration from Roy Padayachie * Ben Martins replaced Dipuo Peters as Minister of Energy * Peters became Minister of Transport, taking over from S'bu Ndebele * Naledi Pandor became Minister of Home Affairs after Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma * Derek Hanekom took over from Pandor as Minister of Science and Technology * Connie September took over from Tokyo Sexwale as Minister of Human Settlements When Zuma was inaugurated as president for his second term in 2014, he named his Cabinet for the next five years, some surviving from his previous administration. But many of these appointments didn't last long either. In his second term as president, Zuma made another three reshuffles, changing finance ministers three times, starting in 2015. * David van Rooyen replaced Nhlanhla Nene as Minister of Finance, only to be replaced days later by former Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan * Van Rooyen instead replaced Gordhan as Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs * Mosebenzi Zwane replaced Ngoako Ramatlhodi as Minister of Mineral Resources * Ramathlodi was appointed Minister of Public Service and Administration, replacing Collins Chabane (deceased) After the ill-fated weekend reshuffle that saw David van Rooyen serve as finance minister for less than a week, Gordhan was brought in to replace him. But it wasn't long before Gordhan was also muscled out - along with a few more ministers who had spoken out against Zuma - in 2017. * Malusi Gigaba replaced Pravin Gordhan as Minister of Finance * Derek Hanekom was fired as Minister of Tourism and replaced by Tokozile Xasa * Dipuo Peters was replaced by Joe Maswanganyi as Minister of Transport * Nkosinathi Nhleko was replaced by Fikile Mbalula as Minister of Police * Nhleko became Minister of Public Works, taking over from Thulas Nxesi * Nxesi was appointed Minister of Sport and Recreation, replacing Mbalula * Faith Muthambi replaced Ngoako Ramathlodi as Minister of Public Service and Administration * Tina Joemat-Pettersson was replaced by Mmamoloko Kubayi as Minister of Energy * Ayanda Dlodlo became Minister of Communications, replacing Muthambi * Hlengiwe Mkhize replaced Gigaba as Minister of Home Affairs But Zuma surprised the country again, fresh off rumours that Blade Nzimande would be fired, shuffling his Cabinet for a second time in 2017. * Ayanda Dlodlo replaced Hlengiwe Mkhize as Minister of Home Affairs * Mkhize replaced the fired Blade Nzimande as Minister of Higher Education * Mmamaloko Kubayi replaced Dlodlo as Minister of Communications * Kubayi is replaced by David Mahlobo as Minister of Energy * Bongani Bongo replaced Mahlobo as Minister of State Security  lance.witten@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
