Cape Town - The Western Cape government will be in crisis talks in Parliament when it makes representations to the national portfolio committee on water and sanitation to discuss the dire water situation in the province. The provincial department of local government, environmental affairs and development planning is due to appear before the committee on Wednesday. Local Government MEC Anton Bredell said the recent rainfall in Cape Town and the surrounding areas as well as snowfall on the mountains had had a stabilising effect on dam levels. "However, dam levels remain critically low before the summer season and we are working with municipalities to ensure no community runs out of drinking water in the coming months," Bredell said. The average level for dams across the Western Cape for the week starting 23 October is 36.5% (2016: 62%). Bredell and other representatives of the Western Cape Government will be appearing on Wednesday before the National Portfolio committee on water and sanitation to discuss the ongoing crisis. "We will be doing presentations on the current situation, ongoing mitigation steps and the outlook going forward. We look forward to discussing solutions and support. To tackle this drought effectively will require a concerted effort from all stakeholders including and in particular national government who we look to for bulk water infrastructure and financial support. We look forward to a fruitful discussion this week." Theewaterskloof is currently at 27% (2016: 52%); VoÃ«lvlei Dam is at 28% (2016: 72%) and Clanwilliam Dam 39% (2016: 99%). Brandvlei Dam is 34% (2016: 58%).  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
