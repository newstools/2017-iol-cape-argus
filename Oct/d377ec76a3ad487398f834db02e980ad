Cape Town - Security remained tight at Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) on Monday ahead of the planned reopening of campuses on Wednesday, following weeks of violent protests. "We [are] still ready to open on Wednesday. We won't back down from that," said CPUT spokeswoman Lauren Kansley. Campuses were closed last week after students protested against the expulsion of four students after charges related to misconduct were brought against them. Over the past few weeks, several classrooms were set alight by protesting students. In a communique from acting vice-chancellor, Chris Nhlapo, he said everything possible would be done to secure the safety of staff and students. "Staff are asked to work remotely, where possible, and to remain on standby so that urgent work related matters can be attended to," Nhlapo said in the letter. "The safety concerns of parents, staff and students have not fallen on deaf ears and management continues to actively engage with all stakeholders to finally bring an end to the disruptions andÂ  violence."
