Cape Town -  The Passenger Rail Agency of SA's (Prasa) Regional Security Manager has written to the company’s corporate offices proposing a turnaround strategy to solve the company's safety crisis. In the letter dated 31 May 2017, Ernest Hendricks unpacked the ever growing challenges Prasa faces which relates to vandalism, robberies and injuries. Hendricks proposed a security turnaround team of three senior personnel be relocated to Cape Town to address the challenges. This would cost the agency around R30 000 a month. The letter also revealed the dire state of Prasa's security team, which included:
* 21 firearms between more than 1 000 members (members had not received training to use a further 51 firearms available to the team)
* 80% of security staff were not registered with the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority
* Some members, including military veterans have criminal records yet to be expunged
* A glaring lack of support from SAPS
* A fleet with an average odometer reading of around 400 000km on most vehicles
* Many members were declared unfit for duty due to illness or substance abuse The letter also revealed that there were airtime claims to the value of R10 million in the Western Cape alone, due to members using their cell phones for communication instead of two-way radios that should have been made available to them. There was also rampant absenteeism, resulting in a lack of personnel available to ensure the safety of commuters, rolling stock and infrastructure. Cape Town's notorious Central Line was also highlighted as a point of concern, with Hendricks writing that if there was a complete "lockdown of are central" losses of more than R100 million could be avoided. These included losses of:
* R55m in train causalties
* R6m in injuries
* R17m in onboard vandalism
* R17m in income
* R2.05m in stone throwing
* R1.86m in vandalism
* R165 000 in robberies
* R123 111 in ticket office robberies These losses were registered between April 1, 2016 and March 31, 2017 alone.   Hendricks told the Cape Argus that he often sent similar letters to Prasa's corporate office in Pretoria, but would not comment further on the letter.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
