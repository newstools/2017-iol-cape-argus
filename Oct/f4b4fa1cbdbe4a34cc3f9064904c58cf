Johannesburg - South African motorists look set to face another fuel price increase in November, although petrol is only likely to increase marginally. Based on mid-month fuel price data from the Department of Energy, the Automobile Association is predicting a petrol price increase of around two cents a litre, while the cost of diesel is likely to rise by about 28 cents, and illuminating paraffin by 20c. The month thus far has seen weaker international oil prices being offset by a weaker South African rand, although the latter appears to be recovering, trading at R13.33 at the time of writing (October 16), versus R13.62 at the beginning of the month. While the landed cost of petrol has dropped by almost 20 cents a litre since the beginning of October, the price of diesel has risen by around six cents a litre, the AA said. "The latest data continues to show how vulnerable South African fuel users are to political and economic sentiment which negatively affects the rand," the AA added. "We are not ruling out a further deterioration in the fuel price picture ahead of month end." South African petrol prices increased by between 25 and 29 cents a litre on October 4, with all grades of diesel going up by 41 c/l. This brought the inland price of 95 Unleaded to over R14 a litre.
