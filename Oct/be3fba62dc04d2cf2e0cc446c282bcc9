Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said in a detailed survey that rape victims were often under the influence of drugs and alcohol. A total of 39828 rapes were reported in South Africa during the 2016/17 financial year. This is down 4% compared to previous years. But according to the latest crime stats, sexual assault had increased by 6% compared to a national increase of 0.9%. Rape decreased by 4%. Rape Crisis said they were concerned about the under-reporting of sexual offences. “As an NGO working to address violence against women, the Rape Crisis Cape Town Trust believes the best way to rebuild faith in the criminal justice system and address the high rates of rape, is to strengthen the criminal justice system through the re-establishment and continued roll out of sexual offences courts,” Rape Crisis’s Jeanne Bodenstein said. Non-profit social justice advocacy group Sonke Gender Justice said it had little to smile about since the release of the stats. "We are not too excited about the stats because those crimes go unreported. But what's strange is that a few weeks ago Stats SA released statistics which contradict the police statistics and indicate that sexual related crime has increased," Sonke Gender Justice Director of Strategic Partnerships Bafana Khumalo said. Khumalo said infrastructure light street lighting and sanitation also played a role in keeping women safe. "We have a long way to go with regards to infrastructure in our communities which puts women more at risk. And some communities don’t have enough police stations," Khumalo said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
