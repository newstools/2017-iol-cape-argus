Cape Town - The Western Cape has created 84 000 jobs in the third quarter of 2017, despite the crippling drought that has hit the province. Chairperson of the provincial legislature's standing committee on economic opportunities, tourism and agriculture Beverley Schäfer welcomed the growth in the number of jobs created in the Western Cape. The Quarterly Labour Force survey was released by Stats SA on Tuesday, showing the country's unemployment rate had remained stable at 27.7%. Also read: Unemployment rate remains stable at 27.7%, but still high "While the Western Cape’s expanded unemployment rate increased by 0.6%, a direct result of the impact of the drought on employment in the agriculture sector, the province still has the lowest expanded unemployment rate at 25.2%. It is, however, deeply concerning to note the severe job losses in the agriculture sector as a result of this disaster," Shäfer said. "I call on the Western Cape MEC of Economic Opportunities, Tourism, and Agriculture, Alan Winde, to ensure that the provincial water augmentation plan also makes provision for Western Cape agriculture." She said the economic gains in the face of the worst drought since 1906 demonstrates the DA's commitment to preserve jobs and protect the economy. "It remains our top priority to make it through this drought disaster, by means of innovative and efficient water management and supply, to protect the livelihoods of our people and our economy at large," she said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
