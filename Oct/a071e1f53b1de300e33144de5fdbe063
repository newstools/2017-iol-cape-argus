As the country awaits the recommendations of the Heher Commission on the funding of university tuition, statistics show that fees make up only a third of universities' income and that historically white university derive a sizeable chunk of income from sources other than fees and government grants. “Those universities do have businesses and foundations and trusts and they have alumni that are well off  and that is what makes the difference. They have that advantage of alumni with businesses,” Statistician-General Pali Lehohla said on the release of his financial statistics for higher education. Stellenbosch University and UCT, which are regarded as historically white institutions, received 43% and 42%, respectively, from other recipients. They got 35% and 32% from government grants. UWC and CPUT, the institutions considered historically black in the province, received 21% and 12%, respectively, from other recipients. They received 58% and 52% from government grants. Professor Narend Baijnath, chief executive of the Council on Higher Education, said a main reason was that most of the previously disadvantaged institutions serve the poor. “They have short histories, without the alumni bases that previously advantaged institutions (PAIs) have, with wealthier alumni who make bequests in their wills, or make donations from their cash holdings driven by philanthropy.” Stellenbosch university got R1.21 billion is from grants and contracts. It received R338 million in donations and R190 million in the sale of products and services. @yo_lisa92  @yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
