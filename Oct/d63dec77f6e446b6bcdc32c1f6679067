Cape Town - Dustbin collectors made a gruesome discovery on Tuesday afternoon when they found a frozen body of an infant dumped in a bin in  Lwandle, Strand, Cape Town. Ward 86 Councillor of Lwandle, JJ Maxheke condemned the dumping of babies. “This is unusual and pure evil, we have heard of babies who were discovered dead in bins but never of a baby found frozen. It appears the baby had been kept in a freezer somewhere before dumped here.If someone doesn’t want their child they must give them up for adoption, contact social workers or leave them in one of the local clinics, what if children discovered this?” Maxheke said no one knew who the parents were. Nobody saw anyone dumping something in a plastic bag, either. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said Lwandle Police were investigating a death inquest after the body of an infant was found at Vulindlela road, Lwandle. “The body, approximately over three months was found dumped in a dustbin, frozen. Community members were checking for old stuff in bins when they found a black plastic bag and they found an infant inside.” Anyone with more information who can assist with the investigation is requested to contact Lwandle Police on 021 845 2060 or alternatively call 082 522 1208.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
