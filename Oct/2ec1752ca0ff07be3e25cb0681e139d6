"We adopted a six-year plan," Mbalula said. "When we adopted the six-year plan, if you as a woman, you have been abused by your partner, you must go to the police station and report the incident. The police officer must take your statement without any preconceived ideas or judgement by asking you 'what were you doing', or how you responded."
