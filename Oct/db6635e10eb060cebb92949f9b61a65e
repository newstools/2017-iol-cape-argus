The Mobile Science Lab initiative was developed by cement company PPC to support budding scientists, and the recent handover forms part of several initiatives that are to benefit schools across the country. Principal Noel Cleophas said they appreciated the donation, and that it would go a long way at their school, which is stretched for resources. “We need equipment, especially with us being a technical high school. Maths and science are very important subjects, and we want to enhance our pupils’ understanding of the subjects. These will be very useful to our school.” He said they had an ongoing battle with violence and gangsterism, and technical subjects offered pupils an escape. “Our pupils face a very difficult future, so we try to uplift them. We try and encourage them on to this technical pathway, because it can change their lives. We hope this investment will make more pupils interested in the subject.” Kabira Akoob, the group CSI manager at PPC, said providing quality, meaningful education remained one of the continent’s greatest challenges. “For education to create tangible future opportunities for our children, corporates need to collaborate with the government and communities to help pupils develop the skills they need to achieve their dreams.” Akoob said they would put measures in place to ensure the labs were used effectively. The rollout was a collaboration with project partner Diebold Nixdorf, and managing director Jean Christophe Bouchen said they were committed to contributing to youth development. “Education is a powerful tool for youth development, and is pivotal to transforming the economy. We are very proud to be part of the handovers.”  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
