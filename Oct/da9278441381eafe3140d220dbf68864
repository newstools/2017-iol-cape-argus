Imagine the spectre of poorly trained troops in your neighbourhood; consider the fact they will be working in unfamiliar ghettos, with a culture they are unfamiliar with, and are expected to contain a militia whose language most of them don’t understand. That no less a figure than Police Minister Fikile Mbalula is asking for this extreme action should indicate we should avoid it at all costs; government’s short-sighted policies are directly responsible for the madness we are forced to live with. If democracy means my children are expected to walk past armed soldiers to and from school, I have to ask what the point of our Struggle was. If jobs are reserved for one race or class, why did I risk my life? Why were many of my peers killed? Have I swopped one oppressor for another? The brown people have gone from relative to extreme poverty, from previously disadvantaged to historically disadvantaged. School closure, mass retrenchment, backyard status and a dramatic spike in drug addiction is all the new dispensation has brought us. Our land is being stolen, aided by the same ANC we fought and died for. We have not been overlooked: we have been replaced, for today our indigenous status means nothing. Apparently the true indigenous people have been replaced; our crime: not having enough pigmentation. When white people complain about 30 years of oppression I wonder if they’ve ever considered how we feel. We’ve known nothing but oppression since Van Riebeeck got off the boat 365 years ago. Our history and culture was eradicated, many of our forefathers exterminated, yet we do not hate; we love and forgive. Injustice cannot prevail: the indigenous people will reclaim that which God himself has given them. * Brigadier General Fadiel Adams is the Media Liaison Officer for the South African Cape Corps
