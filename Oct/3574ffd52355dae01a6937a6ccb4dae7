You are more likely to be attacked while in your car and home as the crime wave engulfing the country has reached “unprecedented levels”. “We must ask whether we have accepted to live side-by-side with violent criminals who literally emote terror across our nation, be they in Lusikisiki or the Hard Livings gangs across the Cape Flats,” Police Minister Fikile Mbalula said as he presented the crime statistics for April 2016 to March 2017 in Parliament yesterday. The Western Cape recorded the fourth-largest number of murders at 3311 (up 2.7%); Gauteng recorded 4101 murders; KwaZulu-Natal 4014 murders (up 2.2%); followed by the Eastern Cape with 3628 murders (down 0.6%). Carjackings, home and business robberies continued to see a steady rise in South Africa, MPs were told. Major-General Norman Sekhukhune, head of police crime research and statistics, indicated that these three crimes, known to the police as “trio crimes”, have seen bigger rises in the 2016/17 financial year than in previous years. Nationally, carjackings were up 14.5%, while home robberies were up 7.3% (compared to an increase of 2.7% in 2015/16) and business robberies were up 5%. Gauteng saw a 16.9% increase in carjackings with 8610 cases reported, followed by KwaZulu-Natal with 3029 cases (up 21.5%), and the Western Cape with 2201 (up 8.3%). The number of home robberies was also most prominent in Gauteng, with 8731 cases (up 10.6%) reported, followed by KwaZulu-Natal 4255 (up 4.2%), and the Western Cape with 2560 (down 0.5%). Gareth Newham, from the Institute for Security Studies, said the police urgently needed to improve their capability to investigate crime, gather evidence and arrest perpetrators. “The root of the crime and policing crises in South Africa is the failure of the president to appoint a highly experienced woman or man of integrity as SAPS national commissioner,” he said. Mbalula said the social issues and gun violence in the Western Cape had placed added strain on police resources. “Despite the decrease in this financial year, some of the individual categories have over the past four financial years tended to reflect an upward trend,” he said. Mbalula also said gangs were becoming more and more sophisticated. Western Cape MEC for Community Safety Dan Plato said it was evident that too many people in the province did not have the luxury of feeling safe in their communities. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
