CAPE TOWN – Western Province’s Currie Cup final hero Nizaam Carr has joined English Premiership club Wasps, where he will play alongside fellow Springboks Juan de Jongh, Willie le Roux and Ashley Johnson. Wasps confirmed rumours that have been swirling around for weeks that they were interested in acquiring the services of Carr, and the club announced on Monday afternoon that the 26-year-old will be on a three-month contract as injury cover. Carr told IOL Sport on Monday that he will be leaving Cape Town on Tuesday, but will return to the Stormers for Super Rugby next year. Wasps said in a statement on their website that they have a number of injuries among their loose forwards, which has seen former Cheetahs No 8 Johnson making a more permanent move to hooker these days. Wasps’ Director of Rugby Dai Young said: “We are pleased to be able to bring a player with international experience like Nizaam into the squad to bolster our back-row options. “Having lost Alex Rieder to a dislocated shoulder and with Ashley Johnson no longer being a back-row option due to injuries at hooker, we have become pretty threadbare in that area. “Nizaam has a strong reputation for his defence, athleticism and linking play, and I’m sure he will prove himself a valuable addition to the squad, even on a short-term basis. We look forward to welcoming him to the club.” Carr enjoyed a stellar season in 2017, which ended in style when he produced another sparkling performance in helping Province beat the Sharks 33-21 in the Currie Cup final in Durban on Saturday. But the very next day, Carr – who has five Test caps – was left out of the 34-man Springbok squad for the end-of-year tour to Europe. @ashfakmohamed  IOL Sport Like IOL Sport on Facebook
