It was unfortunate that the event organiser chose to pre-empt the City's event permitting processes and prematurely announced the closure of Maiden's Cove before an event permit was granted. This is both short-sighted and opportunistic. It is a well-known fact that the Maiden's Cove beach is a popular public amenity accessed by residents from communities across the city. The annual outing to this facility is a highlight for many families, who look forward to making the journey from the four corners of Cape Town. As an inclusive city, we would not seek to deprive our residents of this opportunity. Furthermore, with no end in sight to the protracted drought we are experiencing, we are in for a hot and dry summer. In light of the water restrictions, many of our public swimming pools will remain closed for the summer season, thus driving more people to our beaches. Cape Town, its amenities and facilities must be available for all to enjoy. This is not negotiable. * Alderman JP Smith is the from the Mayoral Committee Member for Social Services for the City of Cape Town. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
