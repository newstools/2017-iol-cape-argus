Cape Town - A woman from Heidelberg will be representing South Africa at the 15th Annual Karaoke World Championships finals which will be held in Helsinki, Finland between November 14 and 18. And Denice Marais, 23, can't wait to fly the flag high. “I am feeling very excited to represent my country.” Marais started doing karaoke for fun, but the competition bug soon bit. “I started partaking in karaoke last year at first I just started doing it for fun and didn't take it seriously, but then I actually started enjoying it,” she said. The eldest of five children, Marais lives on a farm in Heidelberg with her parents. She was named South African Karaoke champion earlier this year.

Her favorite song is Adele’s All I Ask. The karaoke competition, started in Finland in 2003, is the largest and most presigous amature singing competition in the world. It's a full week of karaoke events, including festivals, after-parties and shows, besides the seven rounds of competition featuring singers from 20 different countries. Marais's family couldn't be more happy for her. "My family has been really supportive and they are so excited for me. They are already telling me how much they going to miss me," she said.
