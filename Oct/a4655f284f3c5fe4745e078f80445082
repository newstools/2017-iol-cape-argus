The Mother City Queer Project (MCQP) team will present a Halloween party - MCQP Presents Halloween - on Saturday October 28 and the theme will require revellers to dress up as clowns. MCQP‚Äôs executive project manager Candice Heyns said those with an irrational fear of clowns will face their worst fear as they host a clown party.

Our barmen, known for their outstanding physical fitness and muscles (and never shy to display it) will take exceptionally good care of you all night long.‚Äù Those attending will be able to enjoy both a downstairs and upstairs party area, and the line-up includes DJs Chad, Groovy Q, Sole Elos, Candice Heyns, B_Type and Kanan7 vs El Gordo. MCQP director Ian McMahon said: ‚ÄúFor those who thought that clown parties are only for kidsthink again. We‚Äôll be honouring the scariest clown of them all. Even the clown everyone loves to hate - Pennywise from the movie, IT, it‚Äôs time to get spooky with us. So come join us.‚Äù The event, taking place at 30 Napier Street, close to Crew Bar, in Cape Town, will open its ghoulish doors to the world of monsters and underworld creatures at 20:00 and will continue until Pennywise has finally captured enough souls to satisfy his unquenchable thirst.
