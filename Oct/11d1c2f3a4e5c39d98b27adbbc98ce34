Cape Town - The outcome of an investigation into the partial sinking of a Robben Island ferry will not be released to the public. The South African Maritime Safety Authority (Samsa), which is conducting the probe, told the Western Cape provincial legislature's Standing Committee on Economic Opportunities, Tourism, and Agriculture on Wednesday that it would not be releasing its findings. The ferry, Thandi, began taking on water in rough seas en route to Robben Island on September 15. Its 64 passengers and four crew had to be rescued before the ferry was salvaged. "We are extremely disappointed that Samsa informed us after the briefing that the report will not be public because that report is vital and within the interest of the public,” chairperson of the standing committee Beverley Schäfer told the Cape Argus. Samsa requires all ships to be either licensed or registered. During the standing committee briefing Samsa said Thandi had undergone an inspection weeks prior to the incident. The committee members also pressed Samsa on whether the ferry was compliant or not. "The ferry was surveyed recently and it was compliant with all the regulations," Samsa's Gustav Louw said. Samsa said an engineer was not required to be on the vessel at all times. Shäfer and the committee agreed to meet again next year to discuss the way forward.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
