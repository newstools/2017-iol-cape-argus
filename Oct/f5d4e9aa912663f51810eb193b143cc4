Don’t be fooled by the limited menu, or the five or six optional extras - Woodies has all the burger you could ever want. The hand-made patties are flame-grilled and served on fresh buns with tomato, lettuce and pickles, with mozzarella and cheddar marrying the flavours together beautifully. You can opt for a single or double patty, and the fries complement the meal perfectly. The fries are served in a takeaway coffee cup, skin on and perfectly seasoned. As I mentioned, the menu is limited but that’s not going to matter. If there was more options, you’d spend hours deciding because the flavour combinations are to die for. First, you’ve can choose beef or chicken
patties (it’s halaal at the Belvedere takeout store). Then, you’ll choose original or hot. “Hot” adds chillies to the patty, and whether you want a single or double burger. The patties are 100g each, so a double is a fair man-size. Now, for the extra options - for a few bucks more, you can add avo, beetroot, pineapple or a combo of chutney and peppedews called the “Saffa”. I tried the Saffa; it’s delicious. Be warned, Woodies is not a sit-down joint and while it’s almost always busy, you won’t wait too long to order, or for your meal to be prepared. And the best part? The price, of course! Two double beef burgers, with optional extras and chips served along with each, set us back R151. Perfect for a quick, delicious, juicy Friday night meal. Oh! And make sure you roll up your sleeves before you unwrap it and dig in... it can get messy. Cape Argus
