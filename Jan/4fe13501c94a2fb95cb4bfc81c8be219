Cape Town The water shortage in the Western Cape has grown worse with the Department of Water and Sanitation revealing that dam levels have dropped below 40%. Subject to approval by council on Thursday, the City of Cape Town could escalate restrictions to Level 3b, which will aim to further curb water use. These measures include watering gardens only on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The city also aims to pursue Cape Town s top 20 000 water consumers. We will be able to start communicating with these high users imminently and advise them of punitive measures that might be taken, such as fines for transgressions or the implementation of water restriction devices, if we do not start to see a 20% reduction in their usage, said the city s mayoral committee member for informal settlements, water and waste services, and energy, Xanthea Limberg.Here are a few tips to help with saving water:* Fix faults in plumbing. A leaking tap can waste thousands of litres of water. * If it s yellow let it mellow, if it s brown flush it down. Don t flush the toilet unnecessarily. * Shower instead of bathing. Get the kids to shower together . * Turn off the tap while brushing teeth. * Don t refill the swimming pool. Rather use a pool cover to prevent evaporation.* Make sure washing machines and dishwashers are on the most water-efficient cycles .* Consider long-term investments such as dual flush toilet mechanisms and low-flow shower heads.* Collect rainwater when it rains. Collecting it in buckets or with a JoJo tank can give you a water source for cleaning your car or watering your garden. theolin.tembo@inl.co.zaCape Argus
