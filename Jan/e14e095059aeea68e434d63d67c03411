Cape Town - The local soccer scene has not only spurred on aspiring football players to make a name for themselves, but it has also brought communities together through integration of residents from all walks of life.Allan Roman, chairperson of the 73-year-old football club Saxon Rovers - competing in the Cape Town Tygerberg Football Association - said that they have many coaching and referee programmes to uplift youth. We encourage our teens to become involved in the coaching of youth, but we first put them through a Safa coaching programme. He said the members range from four to 50-years-old and mainly come from the Kensington and Maitland areas. It is a snapshot of our rainbow nation, he said. Every coach in our junior division is actively transferring critical life skills to the kids through positive coaching and reinforcing the importance of listening, understanding and respecting your coaches and fellow players .Roman said soccer clubs like Saxon Rovers promote a fun and safe environment that brings people together.Alonzo Broadley, 24, who plays for the Saxon Rovers third team and is head coach of soccer at Norman Henshilwood High School, says sport can bind a community .He added that soccer can keep negative influences at bay and sport in general upholds positive values. Especially communities, who are influenced by gangs.&quot;&quot;Sport keeps young children off the streets and out of trouble.&quot; It gives them a chance to expose their talent on a broader stage, which can result in being scouted by bigger clubs and agents around Cape Town.
