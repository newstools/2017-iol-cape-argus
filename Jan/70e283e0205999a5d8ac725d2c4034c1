The City of Cape Town's Fire and Rescue spokesperson Theo Layne said seven residential homes and Bezweni Lodge have been damaged. Layne said further assessments of other areas are being carried out, and the fire will take the whole day and night to put out. Layne said an assessment will be made to determine if more manpower is needed to help put out the fire. He said preliminary investigations have begun to find what started the fire but said it started high up in the mountain slopes. Meanwhile the West Coast and De Waal Drive fires have been contained.
