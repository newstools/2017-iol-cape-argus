Cape Town - A Melomed24 paramedic crew is undergoing trauma counselling after being attacked in Silvertown, Athlone, on Friday night. The attack, which took place after the crew had dropped a staff member at home at about 9pm, is yet another on paramedics, who have been heavily targeted in recent months. The crew were attacked by four guys at a three-way stop in Petunia Street, where one of the guys pulled on the front passenger s door, which was locked, and the window was smashed. Lucky there were no injuries, but the crew were left traumatised as they are still unsure what was used to smash the window. The crew are receiving medical treatment and trauma counselling will be given, but the incident is yet to be reported, said Melomed ambulance manager Salaama Joseph.In September, about 1 000 EMS crew and residents gathered at the Brown s Farm sports field as part of an anti-crime campaign, in response to more than 60 paramedics being attacked on duty. There have been incidents recorded in Philippi, Nyanga, Mitchells Plain, Khayelitsha and Atlantis.Last month, two paramedics, who were responding to an emergency call in Walter Sisulu Drive in Harare, Khayelitsha, were robbed at gunpoint of their cellphones.A local paramedic, Amira Ajam, faced her attackers in the Khayelitsha Magistrate s Court on Friday. She and a colleague were robbed on the Day of Goodwill while responding to a call in Mandela Park. Joseph said they want local and provincial government to do more to keep paramedics safe. We want the minister of health to step in and support our cause. MEC for Community Safety Dan Plato should meet with all EMS crews and discuss this matter, which is of great concern as it is becoming worse and now it s spreading in all areas. It s becoming unsafe for all EMS staff, our lives are at risk. Enough is enough. Cape Argus
