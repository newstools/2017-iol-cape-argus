Cape Town - An Ocean View man had a narrow escape when two pepper-spray toting good Samaritans threatened to shoot a knife-wielding teenager who had just stabbed him.Police spokesperson Captain FC van Wyk said they were investigating a case of attempted murder.The pair of heroes, who declined to be named, were heading to a gangster recovery meeting on Tuesday night when they saw the man being chased near Flamingo Road. They followed in their car and shouted at the teen chasing him. The man stopped and turned to face his pursuer and tried to push him away, but the teenager, who could have been about 14 years old, stabbed him once in the chest area,&quot; one of the Samaritans said. We were yelling at him and my friend said he would shoot. The teenager obviously thought the pepper spray was a gun because he stopped and looked across the street where an older man was signalling him to leave. We went to ask the man how he was and he said he was alright. The victim collapsed at the corner of Seagull and Flamingo roads, bleeding profusely. An onlooker attempted to stop the bleeding until paramedics arrived, the men said. Taryn Theron, CMR medical operations manager, said the victim was in a critical condition and was taken to Victoria Hospital.&nbsp;Cape Argus
