Cape Town - The Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has confirmed it is investigating an incident captured on video and doing the rounds on social media in which a police officer allegedly shot dead a colleague during a shoot-out.The video, apparently captured on CCTV and date-stamped January 12, shows three uniformed police officers and a plainclothes officer entering what appears to be a recreation area very cautiously. The officers are then seen opening fire on unseen assailants. A uniformed officer crouches in front of his colleagues, firing bursts from an automatic weapon. Moments later, his colleague is seen firing a shot, apparently meant for the assailants, seemingly hitting his colleague in the back of the head instead. The officer slumps to the ground, lifeless.The officers then appear to retreat after finding themselves in shock. They are later seen returning to the slain officer s body, appearing to move it, before leaving again. Moments later, a third, previously unseen, uniformed officer appears to check for signs of life.Gauteng police spokeswoman Kay Makhubela was reported as saying the police officer was shot after being ambushed by heavily armed criminals and that cases of murder, attempted murder and business robbery were being probed.Ipid spokesman Moses Dlamini confirmed that the circumstances surrounding the officer s death were being investigated by the unit. The incident occurred in Katlehong North in Gauteng during a robbery at a garage (filling station). It was initially reported as a killing of a police officer by alleged robbers. Ipid is investigating a death as a result of police action. I m not in a position to release his name at this stage. A murder docket has been opened. Cape Argus
