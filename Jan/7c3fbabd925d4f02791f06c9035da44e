The damage done last year is estimated at around R12m, Tyhalibongo said on Wednesday.UWC s damages bill was the second highest in the country after North West University, which stood at R151m. Meanwhile, UCT was slightly better off having suffered just over R4m in damages over the past two years.UCT spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said the damage to property due to protest action at the beginning of last year amounted to R3.2m. A Jammie shuttle bus and a bakkie, which were both used by students, were burnt, while vice-chancellor Max Price s office in the Bremner Building was petrol-bombed, Mhlanga said. A number of historic paintings of priceless cultural and historic value were destroyed, statues and signage were damaged by vandalism, and a number of windows were smashed, he said.Mhlanga said UCT incurred further losses of R1.1m during the unrest which began in September when smoke from vehicles which were allegedly set alight by protesting students infiltrated the specialised air filtration system of the Geological Sciences building. The damage has been repaired. The vehicles have not yet been replaced, Mhlanga said.
