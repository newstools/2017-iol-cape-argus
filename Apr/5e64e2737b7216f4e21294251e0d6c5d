ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said: "The people that attack the paramedics, they do not care if they are private or government services, they see people working in dangerous areas at various hours, and therefore see us as a soft target.” Meiring said the company had already identified hot spots. “There are several 'red zones' labelled as dangerous areas, to be entered only if the paramedics have local authorities as an escort or if local authorities are on the scene. Some of the areas are Mitchells Plain, Khayelitsha and Nyanga.” On Tuesday, the Western Cape provincial parliament standing committee on community development, held a second Stakeholder Forum in Site C, Khayelitsha, where the safety of emergency medical services (EMS) was discussed. Khayelitsha is among the top 10 red zone areas marked in four local Metro divisions. Mzwanya Nidbongo of the Khayelitsha Health Forum said safety was of grave concern. "Ambulances do not enter that area without being escorted by police. Remember, paramedics are called for people in critical condition.” Ndibongo said the community formed a committee to look into the issue. Lorraine Botha, chairperson of the standing committee, said she was pleased with the turnout at the meeting. -
