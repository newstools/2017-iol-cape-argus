Cape Town – The luxurious Queen Elizabeth is currently docked in Cape Town. The ship is set to travel to 25 countries and will offer guests a chance to experience “a world class voyage”. The ship will be making stops in Hamburg, New York, San Francisco, Sydney and Hong Kong. Pictures: Henk Kruger The ship has a guest capacity of 2 081 and a crew of 1 005. The crew on the ship is also extremely attentive and promises to deliver great service at the touch of your finger. There’s also something for every palate as the ship offers a world class dining experience, all offered with a variety of wines to accompany your choice of food. On a media tour yesterday, the luxurious interior was breathtaking. It includes a Garden Lounge, a London inspired sociable room that offers afternoon tea and evening dancing, the Royal spa with an in-house royal bath that offers heat therapy to destress and detoxify the body and then for sports enthusiasts there’s the games deck perfect to play traditional bowls or tennis on. And of course there are shops and galleries, a pub, music, theatre and dancing. But of course a night on this illustrious ship comes with a hefty price tag. Accommodation in the Britannia Stateroom will cost you R26 367.78. And if you want the rich life, the Princess Grill Suite is just for you at about R67 221.67. The Queen Elizabeth will be leaving for Hamburg for nine nights from June 12-21.
