Cape Town – The police appear to have backtracked on previous assurances that a fourth police station would be built in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, where the murder rate ranks among the worst in the country. The national Public Works Department confirmed that besides the R100 million that had been set aside for the upgrade and extension of the Muizenberg police station, it had not received any other requests for additional stations in Cape Town. This flies in the face of what former provincial police commissioner Arno Lamoer said in 2014, when he told the Khayelitsha Commission of Inquiry that a new police station would be built in the Makhaza informal settlement. However, Public Works spokesperson Thami Mchunu said: “The Department of Public Works has not received any requests from the police for new police station developments in Cape Town.” Mchunu said the R100m budget for the Muizenberg police station was approved “because it was on the police’s capital works priority list”.
