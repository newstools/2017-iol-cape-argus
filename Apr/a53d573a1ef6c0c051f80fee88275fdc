The annual quiz encourages high school students to test their knowledge of the news and current affairs that can be found within the pages of the Cape Argus. The quiz has become one of the most keenly contested high school competitions, with more than 140 teams entering last year, all competing for the top prize, which ultimately went to South Peninsula High School. The first round of stages will get under way from May 8-29. Masters will put 40 questions to the teams, who score five points for every correct answer, while three points will be deducted for every incorrect answer. Copies of the Cape Argus are delivered to the participating schools. Aziz Hartley, editor of the Cape Argus, said: “The Cape Argus Food Lover’s School Quiz offers not only the chance for pupils and their schools to win big, but also an opportunity for all of us to see the talents of our future leaders. “It is amazing to witness the sharpness of participants and, while not everyone can win, all the pupils who take part are in fact winners.” Niresh Mangaru, director of Food Lover’s Market, said: “We want to empower the leaders of tomorrow. It’s exciting and we want make sure they not only learn, but practice what they learn - allowing them to broaden their general knowledge.” High school teams are not only competing for their share of R200 000 cash, but also other prizes up for grabs.
