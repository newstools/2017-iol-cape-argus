Cape Town – A 35-year-old woman has been arrested after her 3-week-old son Relebohile burned to death in a fire she allegedly started. Three structures were gutted in the fire in an informal settlement in Pholile Street in Lwandle, on Monday. Neighbour Pumla Goniwe, 35, whose house burnt down, said the “drunk” suspect was arguing with her husband over money for the children’s nappies. They then started fighting in front of their toddler. “A few minutes later the woman's husband went out. She locked herself inside, shouting that she would commit suicide and would burn herself. I did not take her seriously and when I smelled something burning I thought it was the bread the suspect was baking.” But the woman had reportedly set her furniture on fire. Goniwe said the husband broke in and rescued the 1-year-old, then went back for the baby and his wife. She said the baby was brought out, but the mother covered him in burning material. “All we could hear was the baby crying but we could not see where he was. Community members risked their lives by going in the fire again to check if the baby had not been left inside but because of the smoke they couldn’t see anything. The baby was later found dead by firefighters.” Bulelwa Madlokazi, a street committee member, said the death of little Relebohile had devastated the community and they wanted justice for him. The mother was not welcome back. Police spokesperson FC Van Wyk said a murder case had been opened. The mother was due in the Strand Magistrate's Court on Wednesday.
