It's a skill learnt in childhood, but most of us appear to be getting it wrong. How we tie our laces makes it far more likely to come undone, say engineers. The mistake is to tie the first knot left over right and then tie a bow in the same way. Instead, if the left lace is crossed over the right, the bow should be crossed right over left. The result will be a bow which sits correctly across a brogue or deck shoe. A study found the weaker knot came undone more often. Daily Mail, UK
