Andrew Plaatjies wore a yellow jersey and blue jeans in the dock. Rene’s sad-looking parents, Eugene Jacobs and Chrissandra Roman, were also at court. A crowd of residents from Lavender Hill protested outside court against the granting of bail for Plaatjies. When community members got a glimpse of the man who allegedly brutally murdered the teen, pandemonium broke out and spectators started shouting, saying he should die. When the courtroom doors opened, those who were forced to wait outside yelled “Hier’s die ding” (Here’s that thing). Plaatjies indicated he wanted to apply for bail. However, the matter was postponed until April 25 for the formal bail application. As Plaatjies made his way down to the cells, Rene’s biological father stood up with supporters and said “Ek gaan jou vrek maak, Andrew” (I’m going to kill you, Andrew). Plaatjies faces charges of rape and murder. Outside court, angry protesters were led by Steenberg Community Policing Forum chairperson Lucinda Evans. “We are appealing to the court to wrap this up within six months,” Evans said. “This is a healing process, and for the parents it’s agonising. No parent wants to sit day in and day out in court reliving that moment,” she said. Rene, 13, went missing on March 10. Her body was found in a wendy house on Human Rights Day, just metres from her home. Her body had been found decomposed and her hands and feet were bound. She was half naked and wrapped in a carpet. Police made an arrest on March 23 when they found Plaatjies in Stellenbosch. When police brought Plaatjies to Lavender Hill, community members attacked the officers in order to get to the suspect. - marvin.charles@inl.co.za
