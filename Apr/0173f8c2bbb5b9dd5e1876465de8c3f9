Cape Town – Andrew Plaatjies, the man accused of killing 13-year-old Rene Tracey Roman from Retreat, Cape Town, abandoned his bail bid on Tuesday. He made an appearance in the Wynberg Magistrate's Court before magistrate Goolam Bawa, where the reasons for abandoning his bid for bail were not given. The gallery was warned to be quiet during proceedings, with the matter attracting attention from around Cape Town. The State requested a postponement for further investigations and to return to the scene where the teenager's body was found. The State was also still awaiting the results of forensic tests. It's believed Plaatjies' defence abandoned the bail application out of fear for his safety. After his arrest in Stellenbosch, the community of Lavender Hill attacked the police in an attempt to get to Plaatjies when the investigating team took him to the area for investigations. Outside court, there were celebrations as Plaatjies was remanded in custody. Local Community Policing Forum chairperson Lucinda Evans said picketing outside the court was only the start of their support for Rene's family. "It's been a tough time for Rene’s family and today is a successful day." She said the community would also picket outside the Mitchells Plain Magistrate's Court on May 3 when the man accused of killing 11-year-old Stacha Arendse would appear. "We are here today to defend our children, we are not asking permission. This is a peaceful demonstration and we are not moving until we hear 'no bail'," she said. Plaatjies faces charges of murder and attempted rape. The matter was postponed to June 23. Rene was found just a few doors down from her home just over a week after her disappearance on March 10.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za
