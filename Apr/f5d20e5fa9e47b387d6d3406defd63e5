Thousands of mourners, some wearing T-shirts with Stacha’s photo and a message saying “Gone but not forgotten” were there. Stacha’s schoolmates read her a poem before singing for her bringing some of the mourners to tears. Thureya Francis, a cousin, said her heart was very sore. “She was more than a cousin; she was like a sister to me. The funniest thing I remember about Stacha is she would always ask if she looked tired and if we say yes she would run to the mirror to see if her eyes are red and that is when she would believe us. She is in a better place than we are. You will always be in our hearts. Rest in peace Stacha,” said Francis. Brigadier Cas Goolam said: “I can’t say it is an honour or privilege to speak in front of you about this young girl.” He said he was embarrassed at what the child had taught him. “If we were half as brave as she was there would be no crime in Mitchells Plain,” he said. In the heat of the investigation into her disappearance she had showed bravery by asking her killer not to kill anyone else but her, he said. After going missing for a day her body was found the following day and Randy Tango, 31, was arrested for the killing. - siyabonga.kalipa@inl.co.za
