Africa said it was unusual that 21 people died on provincial roads this weekend. The last time more than 10 people died on the roads over a weekend was between December 23 and 25 last year. Of the six separate head-on collisions which occurred on Saturday and Sunday in Riviersonderend, Vredenburg, Ceres, Knysna, Rawsonville and N2 Dassiesfontein area near Caledon, eight drivers and eight passengers lost their lives. Five pedestrians were killed on the N2 near Cape Town International Airport, R62 Montagu, Mossel Bay, N7 Potsdam and Springvel, Knysna. Two were hit-and-run accidents, said Africa. “When it comes to head-on collisions, this is a behavioural problem. Motorists take chances, are negligent and inconsiderate, overtake where it is dangerous, drive drunk or are fatigued. They need to respect each other.”  Motorists are urged to assist traffic officers in keeping roads safe this Easter and are urged to join Safely Home on Twitter @WCGovSafelyHome under the hashtag #BeTheChange.
