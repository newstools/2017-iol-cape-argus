Cape Town â€“ Students living at South Point student lodging in Cape Town protested against the apparent lack of basic service delivery at the residence on Tuesday morning. The New Market Junction building in Woodstock, Cape Town, which is used as the South Point res, accommodates 1 200 students who pay an average of R27 000 per student for the year. The building is not an official residence, but is largely used by Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) students. The students complained about a shortage of stoves, poor security and sanitation, and an invasion of privacy by res management. The protest led to a meeting between management and the students where the issues were discussed. Full story in Wednesday's Cape Argus
