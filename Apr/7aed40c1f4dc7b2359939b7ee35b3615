Cape Town – An abandoned building in Atlantis, on the West Coast just outside Cape Town, is a haven for gangsters, drug users and criminals, residents say. The building, which had housed the Dura Youth Centre servicing the area since 1990, was left abandoned in 2011. Mayoral committee member for Area North Suzette Little said the operations of the youth centre ceased due to gang violence in the area. Community activist Allister Lightburn said the building has fallen victim to vandals. "From that time on the centre has been a white elephant. It has been vandalised constantly."         "The sub-council has been approached by an organisation who has shown a interest to operate interventions at the facility. We will follow the city's processes in order to assist where possible." The building had been a cause for concern. "This facility has been vacated due to the continuous violence and shooting in the area," Little said. "The city has renovated the premises previously for the use by the public. However, the premises had been vandalised again." But Lightburn is concerned the City is spending money on maintenance of the building until such time as the development commences. Money that could be better spent in the community. “My concern is that the city spends thousands on these upgrades and the place does not get used.” Ward councillor Barbara Ross said that she is currently waiting for feedback from the city about who would be renting the space. "Currently due to the transformations in the city we are forced to wait. But as the ward councillor I did the inspections of the buildings,” she said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za
