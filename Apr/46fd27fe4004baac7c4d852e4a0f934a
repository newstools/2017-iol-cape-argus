The body of an unidentified woman was found near Monwabisi beach in Khayelitsha at about 8:15am on Monday and the victim was found with an open wound to her head, police said. MEC for Community Safety, Dan Plato, said: “It is shocking as we have had a lot of murder cases of children and women just in one month. We must have more outreach programmes to educate young men so that they can understand they have no right to hurt women and our children as they are our future leaders." “Men must know and understand they do not have the right to raise their hands against women.” Siyabulela Monakali, a spokesperson for gender rights group Ilitha Labantu, said they were still shocked at the news of a man who allegedly killed his 3-year old twins in Hout Bay, and now this. “As a gender rights group we believe this is a concern. Our children and women are increasingly becoming unsafe.” Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “We can confirm that a case of murder has been opened.” Cape Argus
