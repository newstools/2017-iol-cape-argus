Cape Town – The community of Khayelitsha welcomed Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu with Struggle songs to the Zola Secondary School in Khayelitsha, Cape Town, where she spoke at the Chris Hani Memorial Lecture on Sunday. Monday is the anniversary of Hani's assassination in 1993. “Leadership is not about what you say, or what I say; leadership is about what we do,” said Sisulu. Sisulu acknowledged that the governing party was going through "many challenges" recently, in light of the public campaign last Friday to remove Jacob Zuma as the president of the country. According to Sisulu, an ANC national executive committee member, the party's NEC met last week Monday to discuss the issues it faced. “Committee members have said to me they are aware of the current setbacks. We ask that we all work together to serve our people so that the ANC can regain its solidarity and power in 2019,” she said. Flanking Sisulu at the Chris Hani Memorial Lecture was Cuba's ambassador to South Africa, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio. He said Cuba and South Africa had much in common. “History has shown us if we fail in the basics, we won’t survive as a nation.” In light of Zuma's midnight cabinet cull in March and the subsequent downgrade of the country's investment status by two of the world's three biggest ratings agencies, opposition parties have called for yet another debate of no confidence in Zuma.
