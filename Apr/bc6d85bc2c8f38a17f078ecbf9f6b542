Cape Town – To the family it feels like a nightmare they hope to wake up from. It’s been a year since mother-of-one Raymonde Boltman, 24, from Mitchell's Plain, Cape Town, disappeared after her mother dropped her off at the local bus stop to go to work. Boltman went missing on April 20, 2016. She was dropped off by her mother Lillian at 5.10am at the bus stop at Clocktower, Lentegeur, Mitchells Plain. However, it’s believed she never boarded the bus and failed to arrive for work at a plastic factory in Elsies River. Boltman’s sister Genevieve said that as the family remembers Raymonde, it is tough for them. “I can’t describe how it feels; everything feels like a dream. “I don’t know what happened… all I know is my mother dropped her off at the bus station and she never arrived for work,” she said. Boltman’s other sister Rodelphia feels something sinister must have happened. “We were told by the security guard that she went across the road and was talking to a guy and walked away,” she said. The disappearance of Raymonde Boltman is still under investigation by Lentegeur police. Police spokesperson Andre Traut said: “There are no new developments.”  marvin.charles@inl.co.za
