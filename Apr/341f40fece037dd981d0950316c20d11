Cape Town â€“ The family of a four-year-old girl who died of alleged food poisoning on Sunday says her life could've been saved.  Hours after eating from a pot of chicken, the child, Asemahle Ngqibi became ill and started suffering seizures.  The girl's relative, Nonceba Fukuse, said the family approached a neighbour for help.  "We rushed to a neighbour and asked that he transport us to the nearest hospital, but because we could not pay for the ride we were returned home where the child died," she said.  The girl's grandfather, Mxolisi Mhaga also later fell ill and began foaming at the mouth.  This time, the family managed to get transport to rush the man to the clinic. He was later transferred to Groote Schuur hospital in Cape Town.  The family from Weltevreden Valley, near Philippi in Cape Town, ate leftovers from the same pot on Monday, resulting in more cases of illness.  A second child, Anele, 6, died in hospital while seven other people, including three minors, remained in a critical condition in various hospitals in Cape Town.  The police have opened inquest dockets into the deaths of the two children, and are also investigating a possible case of food poisoning.  * Full story in Wednesday's Cape Argus
