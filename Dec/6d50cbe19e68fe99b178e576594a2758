Gifted bassist and composer Shakeel Cullis, 22, from Manenberg, managed to grab the attention not only of his contemporaries, but also of veterans. Early in December he secured partial support towards his tuition fees and is busy fund-raising for the remainder of his expenses. He aims to take up this incredible opportunity early next year. The young musician has performed alongside Icons such as Dizu Plaatjies and Sama and Standard Bank Young Artist winners Nduduzo Makhathini and Kyle Shepherd, and was part of ensembles with Linda Sikhakhane and Mandla Mlangeni. He also works with contemporary music pioneers such as Asanda Msaki (ZA) and Beatenberg. “There were not many role models where I lived. Growing up in a coloured family made me this curious person who always want to explore other cultures. “Anyone can be great, you just have to work hard for what you want. I feel incredibly blessed by the opportunity. I truly regard it as an honour,” Cullis said. Last year, he was an active member of the Delft Big Band, and resumed studies at the SA College of Music at UCT, where he was tutored by Dutch legend Hein van de Geyn. As a teenager he played in indie rock and progressive metal bands before studying towards a bachelor of music degree at the Wits University, where he was mentored by Dr Carlo Mobelli. “Although my  studies have been disrupted due to a lack of financial resources, I retained focus on this journey. It was always my dream to study internationally. “I played at the jazz festival in Norway, and they were impressed and wanted me to study there, but I had to turn down the offer for financial reasons,” Cullis said. Saturday and on Sunday he will perform at the Olympia in Kalk Bay from 7pm with pianist Hilton Schilder, an elder of Cape jazz, as well as Louis Moholo-Moholo on drums. The shows aim to help him raise funds for his trip as he needs to sort out accommodation by the end of December in order to get a visa.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
