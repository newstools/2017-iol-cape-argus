Putting a smile on the faces of pupils at Summit Primary School and Our Lady of the Rosary Educare Centre, Gift of the Givers and McDonald's in Mitchells Plain surprised them with happy meals, party packs, toys and clowns. “These school are among the disadvantaged schools schools in Hanover Park," said McDonald's owner operator in Mitchells Plain, Rafiek Ebrahim. "Some of the children told us they were having McDonald's for the first time. They really touched my heart and I'm happy I got to be part of it. It's part of our job to assist where we can and help uplift communities.”  Gift of the Givers Western Cape branch manager Gawa Sayed said the toys would assist children as they live in gang-infested areas and can't play outside.  “We always prioritise the most underprivileged. For them, having a happy meal, toys, Disney magazines and books makes a huge difference. They were overwhelmed, with some even crying," he said.  "Every child deserves to be happy and live in comfortable and loving communities. We do what we can to see them happy and feeling special. A strong educational foundation is one of most important investments that we can make in building stronger societies. At Summit Primary School, the Grade R and Grade 0 have 70 children and the Educare Centre, 130 children."   okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
