The awards were hosted by the Democratic Nursing Organisation of SA (Denosa) in Pretoria this week. Marilyn Lahana - whom the awards was named after - was a nurse who contracted Ebola while she was caring for a patient who had been transferred to a Johannesburg hospital from Gabon. The patient, a doctor from Gabon, had contracted the virus from the patient he himself was caring for. Lahana died a few days later at Charlotte Maxeke Hospital. Vermeulen, who was born in Heilbron in the Free State, graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in nursing and is the founder and managing director of Itekend Support Group 24/7 Care Centre, which she established in 2001. She has written poems on HIV/Aids to educate the community. Denosa spokesperson Sibongiseni Delihlazo, said Vermeulen’s professional contribution had gone far and beyond bedside nursing. “She has dedicated her professional skills and knowledge to further educating her fellow health workers. “Her warm, caring charisma has seen her dedicate her time to visiting bed-ridden patients in their homes. “Her passion to impart knowledge has also seen her visit schools,” he said. Vermeulen walked away with prize money of R10000, a laptop, certificate and trophy as a token of appreciation.
