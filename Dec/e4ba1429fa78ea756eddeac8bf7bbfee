The Humane Education Programme, an initiative started in 2011, was initially a joint agreement between Adopt-A-Pet, the National Institute for Crime Prevention and the Reintegration of Offenders and Grade 9 pupils at Windermere High School in Factreton. “The aim was to teach children how to show compassion and kindness towards nature and animals. We saw this helped change their attitudes to their surroundings and life,” said founder of Adopt-A-Pet, Cicely Blumberg. “Most children who grow up in violent areas are prone to end up leading violent lives if not taught otherwise.” One of their latest programmes was a snake show. “The aim was to show the children the need to not threaten or kill a snake, but to get a snake handler to remove it to a safe location,” said Blumberg. “The snake show also encourages pupils to face their fears in general, which everyone encounters and needs to overcome in their daily lives.” Adopt-A-Pet went on to host programmes for children in an informal settlement in Philippi. “Residents were killing dogs because of an alleged fatal attack on a young boy and 230 dogs were put down.” The initiative has changed children’s perception of the world around them, Blumberg said, bringing compassion.
