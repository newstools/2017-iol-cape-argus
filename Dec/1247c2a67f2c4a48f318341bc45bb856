Schoonraad  said:  “As men we need to start playing our role and really start doing something. It is always women who are doing things and standing up against this scourge." He said society needed more male heroes.  “Because it is mainly the men who are the perpetrators of abuse and violence against women and children. As men we have a certain responsibility that we must take. We cannot sit back and deny this huge issue from our armchairs. Another problem we have, is most perpetrators have been victims of violence and abuse themselves. These perpetrators also do not seek help for  the abuse they went through and  later in life become perpetrators. It is a cycle we need to break. I come from Mitchells Plain and I have seen this happening,” he said.   For 16 Days of Activism to end violence against women and children, Independent Media will bring you stories behind the statistics. Please DONT LOOK AWAY. We can all make a difference by supporting victims and organisations working to build a future without violence. Cape Argus
