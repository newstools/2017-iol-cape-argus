Adaryll Simpson, 29, from Elsies River graduated with a BPharm degree from the University of the Western Cape on Tuesday.  Growing up in Elsies River Simpson said that avoiding the bad influences was his main motivation to complete his degree. “I had to make the best of my situation. Living in Elsies River is quite a difficult thing. “The motivation from my mother and uncle was what kept me sane enough to realise that there is something bigger out there. My wish when commencing this degree is essentially to have a better life for me and my family,” he said.  After matriculating from Elsies River High School he was forced to enter the working world because of the adversity at home. “The opportunity to study came when I started working at Bellville Melomed Hospital,” he said. Simpson also said the field of pharmacy excites him and there is always opportunity to learn something new.  “Melomed chairperson Ebrahim Bhorat offered to send me to university only if I promised to see the assistant courses through, which I did,” he said.  He stressed hard work, dedication, time management and perseverance are a few of the qualities he had to acquire while completing his degree. Simpson said it was all worth it in the end.  Simpson’s mother, Allison, said it was not easy for her to see her son go straight to work after he was doing so well in high school but she is proud of how far he has come.  “We are finally able to live a better life and it is all thanks to Adaryll. I am very proud and grateful for the sacrifices he has made for me and our family. “I would like to encourage all mothers who may find themselves in a similar position to stick with it. Don’t give up and always support your children,” she said.  His future plans involve gaining more experience in the field of hospital pharmacy and also completing his Masters and eventually his PhD in clinical pharmacy.   tamryn.christians@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
