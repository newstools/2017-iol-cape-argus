The flagship Trans Hex Development along the R60 outside Worcester will see more than 8000 houses built by 2022. Housing MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said the project was approved in August and would comprise a mixed-use development, consisting of various types of houses that would cater for the gap market, poorer households, those looking to rent and potential homeowners. The houses are will be for anyone registered on the provincial housing demand database in the Breede Valley Municipality. “This is one of our flagship projects and certainly one of the biggest so far. We are in the process of rolling more of these projects across the province. Just a few days ago we handed over houses in Eerste River and that project will deliver another couple of thousand houses." Madikizela said there were eight major housing projects in the province along with 14 other projects elsewhere in the country. “I need to stress the point that there will never be enough money to build houses for those in need. Our budget only allows us to cater for between 18 000 and 20 000 families. Currently we are working on plans to further assist where we can to build more houses,” he said. There are currently 26 800 people who require housing in Breede Valley. The provincial housing backlog is over 575 000. “The project will yield over 8 000 housing opportunities. It will be implemented in phases with phase one consisting of 2 544 housing opportunities. “We are investing R2.2bn in this project to accommodate nearly 9 000 families. We are no longer building houses but building communities. We are providing homes to people earning between R0 to R15 000 and those people will all be accommodated here, in Transhex,” said Madikizela. “The Western Cape is a big construction site and 108 000 houses will be built by the end of term of government.”  @JasonFelix   jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
