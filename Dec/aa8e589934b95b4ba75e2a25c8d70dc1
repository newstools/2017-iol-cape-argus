This emerged at Thurday’s seminar on “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era” and the book review of Xi Jinping: the Governance of China II at the Mount Nelson Hotel in the city centre. The seminar was hosted by the Chinese Embassy in South Africa and Independent Media and featured speakers such as foreign policy analyst Sanusha Naidu, and 
Dr Yazini Funeka April, a research specialist at the Human Sciences Research Council. China’s ambassador to South Africa, Lin Songtian said his country and Africa needed each other, enjoyed complementary strengths, and that China-Africa co-operation was faced with rare historical opportunities.  “The new era for socialism with Chinese characteristics is not only a new era for China to secure a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and then embark upon socialist modernisation drive, but also a new era for China to make greater contributions to the world, especially to the peace and development cause in Africa and the wider community of all developing countries,” he said. While Africa was rich in natural and and human resources and needed industrialisation, China needed to relocate its industries and production capacities abroad, Songtian said. “Participants agreed that FOCAC (Forum on China-Africa Cooperation) should convene a summit next year to help China and Africa fully dovetail China’s new development blueprint and the AU 2063 Agenda, synergise China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation, further advance priority cooperation areas and major projects, and jointly draw a new blueprint for China, he said. Independent Media executive chairman Dr Iqbal Survé said that during his numerous visits to China over the last decades he had observed first-hand the human and technological progress, the reduction in inequality, industrialisation, economic growth and other advances that the country had made. His personal learnings of the Chinese president included a determination to create prosperity for all Chinese citizens, commitment to global peace, rooting out corruption in China, and a focus on the development of people as opposed to the development of factions or groupings within China itself among others, Survé said.
