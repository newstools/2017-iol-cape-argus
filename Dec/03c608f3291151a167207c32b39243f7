According to provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa, of the 160 drivers arrested for drunk driving since the start of this month, seven were taxi drivers. The highest reading was at the weekend in Swellendam where the motorist was six times over the legal limit, with a reading of 1.49/1000ml. Mayoral committee member for safety and security, and social services JP Smith said the number of drunk drivers, particularly taxi drivers, was increasing.  “The figures are much higher than they should be. At times you even find a man (driver) with a Hunters in his hand.” Smith said they keep encouraging passengers to lodge complaints and “vote with their feet” by not stepping into a vehicle if they suspected that the driver was under the influence of alcohol or drinking." Smith said part of the reason people were still driving under the influence was the lack of consequence. In the latest crash, three people died and 10 others, including an 11-year-old child, were injured when a taxi and a light motor vehicle collided in Bellville. Congress for Democratic Taxi Association  spokesperson Andile Khanyi said it strongly condemned driving under the influence of alcohol.   yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
