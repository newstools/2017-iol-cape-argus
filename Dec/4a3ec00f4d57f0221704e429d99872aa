“A central goal of the Open Mosque has been to promote fruitful inter-religious dialogue and community harmony. We warmly invite our Christian brothers, sisters, friends, family, colleagues and neighbours to a special Christmas dinner celebration,” said mosque secretary Jamila Abrahams. “Our decision to invite Christians to the Open Mosque emulates the laudable example of the Prophet Muhammad himself when he enthusiastically invited visiting Christians to stay in his mosque and to conduct their Christian worship inside the premises as well,” he said. Aside from a banquet of festive food and non-alcoholic beverages, there will be a programme of music, poetry, prayers, film and talks extolling the underlying interconnectivity between the two great Abrahamic sister religions of Christianity and Islam. “One of the productions to look forward to is a comedy about a Muslim family who celebrate Christmas,” Abrahams said.
