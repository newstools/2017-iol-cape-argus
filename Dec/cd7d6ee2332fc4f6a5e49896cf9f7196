Two months later, he is a happy man after he was allocated a house by the Department of Human Settlements. “Me and my family were placed in Blikkiesdorp and lived there for almost a year. Before moving into Blikkiesdorp, we lived in a toilet. The conditions were unbearable and I just couldn’t take it anymore,” he said. “I approached the Department of Human Settlements in May. As I stepped into their office, the director Milile Kraba,was willing and ready to assist me. They even gave me something to eat and drink to calm me down. I am so grateful." Kraba said there was a high sense of satisfaction in the air. “It feels good to have helped Mr Sellar. Misery was written all over his face when he came to see us. It is good to see how his whole aura has changed as well as his attitude to life. “I consider helping people like Mr Sellar of utmost importance. It is my contribution to restoring human dignity,” Kraba said. When asked what was next for him and his family, Sellar said: “I am going to start painting and tiling my new home this weekend. I want this to be the best Christmas ever for my family.” Sellar also extended his gratitude to those who have helped him in the darkest times of his life. “I would like to thank Ishmial Sayed and his family for assisting us with clothes and food when we were in need. I would also like to thank Housing Subsidy Systems head of department, Sandisile Jija, who was part of making this process quick and successful." The director-general of Human Settlements, Mbulelo Tshangana, said Sellar's story was one that has the ability to touch and inspire others in similar situations. “Getting a house is a human right and we all know the demand is higher than the supply. One just has to have patience and perseverance as Mr Sellar." If you can further assist Sellar call him on 0625595796. Cape Argus
