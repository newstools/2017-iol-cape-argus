Last year, the event underwent some changes and its name was changed to the Sunfoil Big Walk and this year it was changed to the Wholesome Bread Cape Town Big Walk Presented by Jive, as new sponsors came on board.  Event director Dr Elias Parker said they were excited to have the paper on board as a media sponsor and they hoped that it would bring diversity to the event.  “We are grateful that a newspaper of the calibre and stature of the Cape Argus is a part of this walk. We have had various partnerships, but this it the biggest and the best. We are extremely grateful.” He said the Cape Argus coming on board was an indication of how the walk has grown since it began.  “The benefit is huge in the sense of the reach of the walk, it will increase immediately with the Cape Argus being involved. I can’t think of a paper with as much reach as the Argus.” Parker said the event draws crowds of about 20 000 and said they want it to grow by 25%. “With the re-branding, the very prefix of Cape Town gives it a national brand and diversity. It also embraces the concept of it being demographically representative of Cape Town and that is the growth that the Argus will bring.” The event has two distances, a 5km route and the more popular 10km route. Starting at the forecourt of the Cape Town Stadium, the scenic walk makes its way along the Sea Point Promenade and finishes inside the Green Point track. It takes place on March 18.  The event is to raise funds for various charities.    yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
