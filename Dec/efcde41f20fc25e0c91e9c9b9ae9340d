Stones were thrown and roads barricaded when police had to save the teenager from people baying for his blood. He was taken to a place of safety. Ward councillor Sheval Arendse said according to residents of Tafelsig, Mitchells Plain, the five-year-old was apparently lured to a Wendy house, and later reported to her mother what had happened. “I am waiting on reports, as she was taken to hospital. I understand the anger of the community but their behaviour was unacceptable. If this is going to happen when  the SAPS comes out to protect the innocent until proved guilty, there will be no law and order,” Arendse said. Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said  there was an incident of public violence at about 4.30pm on Monday. “In AZ Berman Drive and Bokkeveld Street, tyres were set alight and several incidences of stone throwing occurred. It is believed that the community were up in arms due to the alleged rape of a minor, aged five years old. It is further alleged that the suspect is believed to also be a minor aged 13. "Due to the sensitive nature of the alleged incident, we are not in a position to comment any further. A preliminary investigation is still ongoing.” Cape Argus
