But the callousness of the act of causing the death of a child doesn’t end there. The driver allegedly responsible for the fatal crash fled, escaping responsibility for their actions. The Cape Argus urges the authorities to spare no resource in finding the person responsible for this act, and once they are brought to book, to deal with them with the full might of the law. We also urge other road users, motorists, passengers and pedestrians to be extra vigilant over the festive period. It’s not called the Silly Season for nothing - there is a marked increase in road fatalities due to negligence, drunken driving, and a general drop in common sense among all road users that appears to be synonymous with the festive period.  The festive season death toll is something you will hear and read about more and more during December and into January. Road blocks to catch errant drivers increase, there is an extra deployment of law enforcement and traffic staff on the roads, and multiple media campaigns urge restraint and common sense to be applied during this period. This newspaper joins the call. If you drink, don’t drive. When you’re in a vehicle, buckle up. If you’re driving, don’t speed. If you’re using the road - whether behind the wheel, handlebars or on your feet - be extra vigilant and always be aware of your surroundings. Look out for the other road users. It might not be your fault, but that won’t necessarily stop you from becoming a statistic. This all appears to be common sense at all other times during the year. Why should the onset of the Silly Season change our mindsets? Let’s keep the 2017 holiday season from being silly, and maintain its status as “festive”. Cape Argus
