This weekend roads will be congested as many  people will be travelling, as schools are closing. Motorists are urged to ensure all passengers, especially children, buckle up. AA spokesperson Layton Beard said that according to the latest statistics, less than 7% of South African children are transported in car safety seats. “Saying this is essential would be an understatement, it is critical and studies have proven that in most road accidents children were saved by car seats. "There is no excuse for a child not to be strapped, many organisations even provide for those who cannot afford baby seats.”  Spokesperson for Wheel Well Peggie Mars said: "Car seats can keep a child in the car safe. Every child has the right to safety and we understand not every parent can afford a safety seat hence we give them for free. We make sure they are in good repair before distributing them to less fortunate families.” Click here to find out more about Wheel Well, or to make a donation.
