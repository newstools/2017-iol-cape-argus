It has been hard hit by the drought gripping the province. According to the Department of Mineral Resources, the water resource was discovered by the Council for Geoscience (CGS), a statutory science council reporting to Minister of Mineral Resources Mosebenzi Zwane. The discovery was made while conducting research on the development of shale gas. The department said the preliminary results indicated that the water was of good quality and suitable for drinking.  Zwane said the much-needed water resource brought huge relief to the drought-stricken Beaufort West town and the Western Cape. He had directed the CGS to conduct a baseline study to enable the government to make informed decisions related to science-based evidence on the development of shale gas resources in the vast Karoo Basin. “Once the CGS finishes its surveying at the end of January, five boreholes will be officially handed to the municipality to ensure that the people of Beaufort West and nearby communities can have access to water,” Zwane said. Beaufort West mayor Japie van der Linde and MEC for Local Government Anton Bredell welcomed the discovery. In Cape Town, ratepayers have been asked to share their views on a draft amendment bill that seeks to reduce demand on municipal water by adding regulations on alternative water use. Xanthea Limberg, mayoral committee member for water, waste and energy affairs, said key proposals included expanding the regulations on alternative water use and on efficient plumbing fittings.  Mayor Patricia de Lille says Capetonians are still not saving enough water.    jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
