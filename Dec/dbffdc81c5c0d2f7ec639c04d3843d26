Cape Town - Aquila Private Game Reserve staff and visitors were thrilled to discover a rather unexpected new addition to the crash, after a new calf was born during the daylight hours of Sunday. The surprise newborn, whose gender is still to be determined, is the second calf to the breathtakingly beautiful cow, who gave birth to her first calf on December 16 , 2015 – almost two years ago to the day. This comes while the reserve was still relishing in the recent birth of healthy white rhino calf born just three short weeks ago. Reserve owner Searl Derman said ““It has been a remarkable few years for the rhino population at Aquila.” Female white rhinos are pregnant for approximately 16 months and give birth to only one calf. Calves are weaned at around two years of age and will stay with their mother until they are about three years old. The mother of a calf is not likely to mate with a male until her calf has left her to pursue its own life of independence. Constantly under the watchful eye of the sophisticated and experienced Anti-Poaching Unit, the increasingly thriving and growing crash is something that Aquila is proud of, as it forms a major part of the conservation initiatives ensuring the strengthening of the gene pool and ultimately the survival of the species.
