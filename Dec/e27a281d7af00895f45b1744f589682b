Susan, the wife of former chief executive at Sotheby’s, Jason Rohde, died on July 24 last year. Her body was found in the bathroom at a hotel room the couple shared at Spier Wine Estate. Initial reports suggested she had committed suicide by hanging herself on the bathroom door using an electric cord. However police investigations and an autopsy report found that she has been killed by manual strangulation. Jason is on trial for her murder. Defence lawyer Graham van der Spuy was cross-examining senior forensic pathologist, Deidre Abrahams and focused on an extract from the book, ABCs of Forensic Science. He said according to the literature, histology or tissue sampling, was mandatory in hanging cases. “I am advised by experts that given your findings it would have been mandatory to do histology on tissue and on skin surrounding ligature marks; including the brain, lungs, intestines and stomach. You missed the opportunity of potentially obtaining evidence that would be independently viable.” Abrahams said histology was not mandatory. She said it was up to the doctor’s discretion. “Histology is not mandatory if you have firm cause of death. We have seen injuries that vastly contradict the application of ligature before death." The trial resumes on Monday.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
