Miss South Africa 2018 will be crowned on May 27 at the pageant's diamond jubilee. Adè van Heerden, who was crowned Miss South Africa 2017 last week following Peters’s victory, was in the same month placed in the Top 10 at the Miss World pageant. This was a first for South Africa where a princess was placed in the final 10. Former Miss SA and Sun International spokesperson Claudia Henkel said: “We are delighted with what has been achieved in the past three years. "With having two international winners, the team behind Miss South Africa is passionate, motivated and eager to embrace what 2018 holds for the brand.” The pageant's main sponsor Cell C’s spokesperson Suzette van der Merwe, also a former Miss SA, said: “Our aim was to restore the pageant's historical glamour and prestige and to make Miss South Africa relevant and a recognisable household name.” Registration for Miss South Africa 2018 is open on the Miss South Africa website www.misssa.co.za Cape Argus
