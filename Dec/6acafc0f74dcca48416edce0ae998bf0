Organiser of the tournament Hylton Mitchell said the tournament was a fantastic opportunity where young people could compete and showcase their abilities. “It is a privilege to run this initiative together with the City of Cape Town and all our other partners. D’Oliveira is a legend who had reached milestones in his time and so it is important for young people to take heed of that throughout this tournament,” he said. Tournament director and retired headmaster of Westville Primary in Mitchells Plain, Neville Williams, said: “The development of the cricketers’ potential plays a meaningful role in the industry. The rich history of D’Oliveira’s career plays a significant role in this tournament.” Ward councillor Mark Kleinschmidt said the district was honoured to be a part of the tournament honouring D’Oliveira.  “I applaud and commend the people in hosting this festival," he said.  Gang violence in communities was a major problem on the Cape Flats. The festival helps untap talent to allow young people to overcome these challenges, he added.  Among the players who participated was 13-year-old Maahir Joseph from Primrose Cricket Club. Jacobs, who has been playing cricket since he was 9 years old, said that he was grateful for the opportunity to be part of the tournament. His father, Wahieb Jacobs, from Kenwyn, said he believes the festival is a great initiative.  “This is a big stage for children from disadvantaged communities across the Cape. The children take this very seriously and therefore I urge the local communities that these children come from to come and support them,” he said.  Mitchell said once the festival grows, he is hoping to include a girls competition.  Cape Argus
