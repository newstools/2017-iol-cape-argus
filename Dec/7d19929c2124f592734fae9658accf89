The sprawling, expertly designed gardens showcase the country’s unique biomes, offering an unequalled experience of our unique landscapes. You’d do well to get there early to ensure you have enough time to cover all the ground. From succulent gardens to a labyrinth of lavender, every conceivable kind of garden can be found on the massive estate. There are two restaurants should you get hungry: Babel you’ll have to book in advance for, and be prepared to wait for a table at the Greenhouse further back on the estate. There’s also a spa, and the products used can be purchased on site. It’s the perfect place to do your Christmas gift shopping, as there are all manner of beauty products, home-care, home-ware, preserves, clothing, accessories and perishables on sale. Bread baked daily in the archaic bakery pairs wonderfully with the home-made jams and pickles. You can also buy an array of eggs laid right there - from quail to chicken. My favourite part of the estate is the charcuterie, where you’ll find every kind of cured meat to satisfy any meat lover’s palate, along with spices so you can cure your own. Pack plenty of sunscreen and make sure your batteries are charged to make use of every photo opportunity. At the end of the day, you’ll find your soul has been recharged as well.  lance.witten@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
