Among the many accolades, Small is commonly known as a playwright, poet and writer. He has however, through his work, also contributed immensely to the fight against discrimination and apartheid. It is fitting that this bust be placed in the Artscape, as it is a theatrical space, which is well known for championing the various forms of the arts, while also exposing many young people from Cape Town and other parts of the Western Cape, to the operations of a theatre. They understand the important role they have to play in nation-building and social cohesion, in not only the City of Cape Town or the province, but the entire South Africa. Even though he’s no longer with us, this bust and his work will forever serve as a reminder of how the arts can be utilised to effect change. I encourage all residents of the Western Cape and beyond to go and view the bust, while at the same time also learning more about this great man’s contribution to our province and country. We salute this historic moment and Small for continuing to advance the arts and still inspiring many others. * Lennit Max, MPP ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers.
