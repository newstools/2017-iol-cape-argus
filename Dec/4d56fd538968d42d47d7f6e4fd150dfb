After being on the run, the suspect handed himself over to the police. Police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said: “The man will appear in the Athlone Magistrate’s Court and detectives are expected to oppose bail. The suspect was also wanted for other crimes.” Unathi’s father, Dumalisile Sabsana, said although the man had been arrested the family was still fearful as they had witnessed the murder. “If a restraining order did not stop him from killing my daughter what will stop him from killing witnesses? We just hope bail is really denied. We wouldn’t be able to face him again. We also appreciate the support from all communities and police who pressured him until he gave up his freedom,” Sabsana said. Unathi was mother of a 10-year-old boy. This came a day after Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkhongi visited the family.  “I assured them that police would not sleep until the suspect was apprehended. He was out on bail which we are contesting. People like him don’t belong in our communities.We need to send a strong message to all criminals who think they can terrorise our communities,” Mkhongi said.   okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
