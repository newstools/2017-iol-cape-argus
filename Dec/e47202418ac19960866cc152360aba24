“This year, the Recreation and Parks Department has a pool of 100 lifeguards for deployment in addition to the 1500 volunteers and 270 trained and accredited temporary lifeguards,” said JP Smith, mayoral committee member for safety and security, and social services. “We made this arrangement to compensate for the closure of many municipal swimming pools, that will likely see an increase in visitor numbers to our beaches and tidal pools.”  Smith said much of the success of this operation would depend on the co-operation of the public. “We still have far too many people who swim outside designated bathing areas and disregard instructions of lifeguards.” Beach-goers are reminded that alcohol is not permitted at any Cape Town beaches or swimming pools. “More than two-thirds of injuries and drownings involve people who are under the influence. Any alcohol found on beaches will be confiscated.  “Since December 1, some 3 700 litres of alcohol have been confiscated from beaches and other public spaces,” said Smith.  Two drownings have been reported at Mnandi Beach on the False Bay coast, and the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI) is urging extreme public caution around the coast this week with the new moon spring tide which peaks today. The NSRI has supplied festive season safety tips:   Swim only at beaches where lifeguards are on duty, obey their instructions and only within the safe swimming zones lifeguards mark (using their red and yellow flags).  Children should always have responsible adult supervision around water.  Anglers fishing along the shoreline, particularly along rocks on the shoreline, are at greatest risk during the spring tide. They should not turn their backs to the sea and should be vigilant of the wave action at all times while fishing. Cape Argus
