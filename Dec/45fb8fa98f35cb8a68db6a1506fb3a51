Wilfred Olifant, 35, was handed 15 years' imprisonment for each of the murders by Western Cape High Court Judge Nape Dolamo, who ordered 10 years to run concurrently. In his plea, Olifant admitted that on June 3 he killed Octavia Skippers and Cleo Skippers. He said he met Octavia at a friend’s place where he had gone to smoke mandrax and tik. He said the friend asked that he accompany Octavia and her daughter Cleo home because it was dark and they lived in the same area. After killing Cleo in the bushes, he began assaulting her mother. He put her head on a V-shaped piece of wood and stabbed her in the neck with a broken bottle. Olifant left the two in the bushes and went home. The bodies were found two days later.  After the discovery, he went to hand himself over to the police and confessed to the crime. Octavia died of blunt force trauma to the head and neck while her daughter died of blunt force trauma to the head. In court Octavia’s mother, Lena Skippers was overwhelmed by emotions. She told the court Olifant was a family friend. “You took both of them my heart is sore. You have killed me just like you killed my children,” she sobbed. Olifant through his defence advocate, Susan Kuun, replied to Lena. “I didn’t mean to do it. It just happened.” Kuun said Olifant had shown remorse. She said he acted under the influence of drugs. “The murder was senseless, unplanned and spur of the moment. He covered the faces of the deceased because he couldn’t face what he had done. Indeed it is a serious offence but he did not try to implicate other people,” she said. State prosecutor Esna Erasmus said Olifant abused the trust the deceased had in him. “He didn’t spare the little girl. He killed her too. There was no sense of sympathy from him, no reason or motive  to justify his actions. This is the kind of person that you should be very scared of,” she said.    zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
