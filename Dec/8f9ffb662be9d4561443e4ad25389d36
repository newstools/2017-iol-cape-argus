The R14-million facility boasts world-class amenities for the public and is completely accessible for people with disabilities. A key feature is its particular focus of providing services to children, the department said in a statement. The facility is the first in the province to be built with a child play therapy room which enables specialist child protection social workers to assist children who have been physically, emotionally or sexually abused. This being 16 Days of Activism Against Women and Child Abuse, Fritz stressed the importance of social worker services being accessible to the communities that need them most. “We are building these facilities within communities so that social workers, can be directly accessible to children and families. This is not only our pledge during these 16 Days, but throughout the year,” he said. “This is why we took the strategic decision to reconfigure this department in 2011. We have transitioned from one head office and 16 district offices, to a head office and six regional offices, overseeing 37 local offices. That’s what service delivery is about - being rooted in communities.” Specialist services that will be rendered by the Langa local office include child care and protection services, probation services, substance abuse interventions, and family and parenting support 
services to the surrounding community. ANA
