Hundreds of youth members used their Sunday to clean up Cape Town communities as the church held the Mother’s Street Project Environmental Cleaning campaign to continue raising awareness about climate change. Volunteer service organiser Lesley-Ann Damons said the fact that tons of waste were collected in one day meant awareness must not stop. “We have been cleaning since the last week and this is the 4357th Worldwide clean-up.We are standing up against the global trash problem and cleaning up waste, making it the biggest positive civic action. We also aim to unite the global community, raise awareness and implement true change to achieve our final goal: a clean and healthy planet." Damons said as a church there were many things to do to provide hope in communities and one was showing that people can live in a healthy environment. The church has a relationship with the solid waste department of the City council, which informs the church which locations need to be cleaned.  Church member and volunteer Abongile Ndzendze said the clean-up included streets, parks, illegal dumping sites and rivers. “We know one day is not enough to clean up places like Langa and Khayelitsha, that’s why we keep on coming back. It is also up to the community to sustain this."   okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
