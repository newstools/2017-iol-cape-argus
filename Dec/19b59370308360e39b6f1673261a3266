The move by Goss comes after Arendse made several claims about him in social media posts and letters to police top brass. Earlier this year, Arendse put several posts  on Facebook, some where he posted screengrabs of Goss's Whatsapp chats. One of the chats, that was of a sexual nature, between Goss and a female was posted on Facebook. Arendse also posted Whatsapp screen grabs of a police group chat in which provincial commissioner Khombinkosi Jula labels a community leader from Mitchells Plain “the nemesis”. He also claimed in a letter to Police Minister Fikile Mbalula that Goss would be joining union Solidarity after he retires in March. “Goss joining Solidarity just adds another piece to the co-ordinated puzzle as it should be read in conjunction with the ongoing calculated plot by the DA and their politicians, Dan Plato and JP Smith who have always targeted MK Cde Jeremy Vearey in particular. The deranged Plato has even allowed his office and the office of the so-called Police Ombudsman to be used to peddle uncorroborated drivel against Vearey which could never be substantiated,” his letter read. Court papers show that there are two counts of defamation against Arendse signed off by the Director for Public Prosecutions (DPP) in the Western Cape advocate Rodney de Kock. Asked for comment, Goss said: “Please ask the DPP for comment.” @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
