Chloe Louw  was with her parents Andre and Lee-ann Louw and 14-year-old cousin, and were on their way home after visiting family in Ocean View. The uncle of Chloe, Denver Bowers, said the family was devastated about the loss of the baby “who just came into our lives recently”. “When I received the call from my brother in-law Andre between 8pm and 9pm, he said a white bakkie had swerved into them and that the baby was in a critical condition. We were devastated when we found out later that  night that Chloe had passed away. “Chloe was sitting on her mother’s lap in the back seat of the car and my 14-year-old niece, Tasha Abrahams, was sitting in front with my brother-in law. The bakkie came from the opposite direction as my brother was driving toward Beach Road. After coming around the circle it swerved into their car on the side where Chloe and her mother were sitting. The drivers of the bakkie fled and ran toward the bushes.” Chloe’s mother  sustained minor injuries while her husband Andre suffered a shoulder injury.  Police are investigating. This weekend also saw at least 14 people arrested on drunk driving charges on Western Cape roads. Provincial traffic chief Kenny Africa said they have also issued fines of R18 700 for traffic-related offences. “There have been no reports of fatalities on the roads thus far.” Cape Argus
