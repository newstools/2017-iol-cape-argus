A few months ago, the Mitchells Plain community was rocked by cases of child murders and rapes. Recently Randy Tango, 32, from Tafelsig was found guilty of raping and murdering 11-year-old Stacha Arendse.    Community activist Joanie Fredericks said: “This community has got enormous talent and the show was a way for them to showcase their talent.  "We need more programmes like these for our children because there are too much negative things, such as crime happening.  "It was a day during which they could just be kids. The singer Blaq Pearl also attended the event only to find her three-year-old baby girl an instant star and winner." Blaq Pearl, who is also from Mitchells Plain, said it was an emotional moment for her when her daughter won.  “It was the first time I saw her singing on stage. But all the kids who took part in the competition were tremendously talented. And a lot of these children never get an opportunity to sing on a stage. It meant a lot to them.  "It is also important that the children receive training. My foundation has started a life-skills programme for young artists called: ‘Sisters with Attitude’. The aim of the programme is to unlock young people's true potential through their talent."   argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
