Cape Town - As Level 6 water restrictions loom over the Western Cape, citizens are getting through the level 5 water restrictions. The Level 6 water restrictions is set to kick in on the January 1 with stricter rules in a bid to postpone Day Zero. But what are we allowed to do now and what do we need to restrict? What will the rules be for Level 6 water restrictions? We break it down for you. The rules for the current Level 5 restrictions are as follows: It's summer and the heat is scorching, however, slaying at the pool is not an option. No automatic or manual topping up of swimming pools with municipal drinking water is allowed.  Lawns and gardens have taken a knock and are most likely looking very dry as residents may not water the lawn with municipal drinking water.   If your windscreen is so dirty, some passer-by wrote 'Wash me', step away from the bucket. No washing of cars, trailers, caravans or boats with drinkable water is allowed. Flats and housing complexes consuming more than an average of 20 000 litres per residential unit per month will face a hefty fine.  When Level 6 water restrictions are implemented, brace yourself for the following: Day Zero might have been delayed slightly but residents should still keep their water usage to strictly 87 litres a day. Non-residential properties are to reduce consumption by 45% and agricultural users are expected to feel the pain as they are required to reduce consumption by over 60%. The use of borehole water for outdoor purposes will not be allowed. There will also be a drought levy. In theory, a residential property with a valuation of R800 000 are expected to pay a drought charge of R45 and properties valued at R4 million would fork out R225. Households using more than 10 500 litres per month could face fines and penalties,   IOL
