“Predators who prey on young children are out there,” warned Social Development MEC Albert Fritz. He encouraged parents to be extra-vigilant and to constantly check on their children. Fritz said the festive season, although seen as a break, was a time for parents and authorities to work around the clock to ensure the safety of their children. “Predators are out and about everywhere. They are at the beaches targeting small children, girls and boys. They are clever in targeting children even when authorities are around. “We call on parents to do the basics; check and monitor your children at all times,” he said. Fritz said with the closure of swimming pools because of the drought more people would instead be flocking to the beaches. Lorraine Botha, DA chairperson of the standing committee on community development, also warned parents to be extra vigilant.    zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
