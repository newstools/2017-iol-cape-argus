Primrose took the champions title from the inaugural winners (in 2016), St Augustine Cricket Club. Cricket icon Basil D’Oliveira was a player at St Augustine, hence the cricket event named in his honour. This year’s batsman of the U17 competition was Quinn van Oordt from Tygerberg with 163 runs scored in the tournament.  Bowler of the tournament was Michael Fillies from St Augustine, who took 8 wickets throughout the tournament with his best being 4/11 in one of the games.  Player of the tournament also went to Quinn van Oordt with 8 catches, 3 wickets and 163 runs.  Khayelitsha Cricket Club won the title of “The Most Promising Team for 2017” as they won their group of the bottom four teams, beating Mitchells Plain in their bottom log final.  The tournament honours the legacy of D’Oliveira who, because of the colour of his skin, was unable to play cricket professionally in South Africa.  His inclusion in the England Test squad to tour South Africa in 1968 sparked the "Basil D’Oliviera incident", which saw SA ban him from re-entering the country to play for England and would spark the international boycott of South African cricket because of its apartheid policies. There was also a lighter side on the final day of this year’s festival. The finalists of the festival headed for St Augustine Cricket Club in Elfindale, 
supported by Peninsula Beverages, the City of Cape Town and the Cape Argus. A City of Cape Town team took on a Cape Argus team in an exhibition match, providing fun viewing for the scholastic crowd. Cape Argus
