The sentence came as result of the three criminals ambushing the emergency personnel and taking one of the staff member’s cellphone, bank card and car keys.   “We welcome the hefty prison sentencing handed down by the Wynberg Regional Court to three individuals who attacked a female Emergency Medical Staff (EMS) member on June 5, 2017, in Manenberg. We thank the community of Manenberg for their instrumental role in seeing those responsible being arrested and the stolen goods recovered and returned.  “The sentencing should be a constant reminder to those who are hell-bent on attacking or robbing our EMS workers: You will be caught and 12 years in jail awaits you,” said Ewald Botha, spokesperson for the community safety MEC. The sentencing of the three follows an earlier 12-year sentence, handed down in October, to a suspect involved in the aggravated robbery of an EMS member in Khayelitsha. Botha further said: “Key to these sentences is the fact that the court recognises the impact such attacks have on the ability of the Western Cape government to provide critical services, especially to poor communities. “We urge communities to continue to support and safeguard all emergency support personnel, including medical, policing, fire or law enforcement, when they operate in our communities.” Cape Argus
