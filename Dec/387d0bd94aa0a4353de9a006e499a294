Several malls contacted said they have security plans in place for the festive season  to ensure that consumers are safe. Tygervalley Centre, located in Durbanville, said that it beefs up security ahead of its busiest period. “We always  beef up our security complement during the busy periods around this time,” Tygervalley spokesperson Laretha Blom said. She added that the extra security measures had already kicked in when schools closed. The  centre constantly buzzes with activities for youngsters of various age groups.  Blom also advised shoppers to be extra vigilant at all times. “The safety of our customers and shoppers are of the utmost importance and Tygervalley will always strive to deliver on a pleasurable shopping experience. Look after your personal belongings.  Always keep an eye on your children, and don’t leave valuables in your car,” she said. Canal Walk, in Cape Town, will also increase security. Its trading hours will be much longer and will come into effect in the week of Christmas. “All festive security procedures are in place. We do urge shoppers not to leave any of their belongings unattended,” spokesperson Vanessa Herbst said. It’s not the first time malls in Cape Town have put extra security in place. Last year some  decided to do so  following a terror threat warning issued by the US. The security alert followed a public call by Islamic militants for global terrorist attacks during the holy month of Ramadaan. Elite shopping malls in both Cape Town and Johannesburg were named as potential targets. The Cape Argus contacted Cavendish Square and Table Bay Mall to ask whether they would be implementing extra security measures ahead of the festive season. Both declined to comment.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
