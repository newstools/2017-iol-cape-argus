The iCCAN non-profit organisation said they wanted all moms to revitalise, reconnect and rediscover their love for life and become part of a community of moms who inspire and support one another. iCCAN’s Candice Willenburgh Syce, said: “Mothers are the glue that holds society together and an investment in mothers is an investment in society. “The organisation is based on three pillars which include: practical assistance; social upliftment; and education. We want to achieve this through our mom and kids club (social upliftment), annual food and clothing banks and workshops.” She said she also wants moms to re-energise in a child-free environment with who they fundamentally are before they became mothers, daughters, sisters or caregivers. ”It is about re-connecting with self without a label attached and finding out how they can tap into their personal resource to bring about change within themselves first and thereafter impact everyone else around them,” Willenburgh said. She added that the organisation was currently focusing on moms residing in Strandfontein and Mitchells Plain and surrounding suburbs on the Cape Flats. They also welcome all moms and children to the club. “It provides an opportunity for moms and kids to get together in a safe environment, doing something fun and interacting with other moms. It’s also an opportunity for kids from the same neighbourhood to get together and possibly experience new things,” she added.  For more information please call: 081 710 1170.
