John Boyega has said 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' is "very messy" but explores war in a different way to other films in the hit sci-fi franchise. The 25-year-old actor made his debut as Stormtrooper-turned-Resistance fighter Finn in 2015's 'The Force Awakens' and will reprise his role in the upcoming eighth installment in the sci-fi saga this December, and he has tantalisingly teased that the story offers a new perspective on "good and evil" and conflict that hasn't been dealt with before in the franchise, which was started by George Lucas with 1977's 'Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope'. READ: Disney announces new 'Star Wars' trilogy Speaking to Variety, Boyega said: "I think we're just keeping it moving, to be honest with you man. The pressure's on. There's no time. I think that's one thing that's unique to me, about watching this movie, was the commentary on war. There hasn't been a 'Star Wars' movie, yet, that has explored war in the way 'The Last Jedi' does. It's very messy. The categorising of good and evil, it's all mixed together." The seventh movie saw the return of Han Solo (Harrison Ford), General Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher) and briefly Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) from the original trilogy. However, Han was shockingly murdered by his own son Ben Solo/Kylo Ren (Adam Driver) but Boyega said his character and Rey (Daisy Ridley) don't have time to mourn his death. Boyega said: "In terms of Han, I'm sure we all feel sentimental if someone was to sit Finn down or Rey down. But Rey's off training, she's got stuff to do. I got a back injury, I've got stuff to do. Can't think about Han at the moment." 'The Last Jedi' - which is helmed by director Rian Johnson - also stars Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron), Lupita Nyong'o (Maz Kanata), Gwendoline Christie (Captain Phasma), Anthony Daniels (C-3PO), Andy Serkis (Snoke) and Domhnall Gleeson (General Lux) who are all reprising their roles.
