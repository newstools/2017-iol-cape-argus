Salma Ewing, 17, from California has won her first pro circuit title in the competition. Salma was coached by her mother Rayana Abrahams Ewing, a former tennis player from South Africa. “Coaching her has been really rewarding. I’ve seen the progression over the years and I’ve seen her develop,” Ewing said. Salma started playing tennis at the age of 10. The Digicall Futures was launched last year at the Maties Tennis Club in the Coetzenburg sports grounds of Stellenbosch University. The series consists of three tournaments which has both men and women participating. Each tournament would have a 32 men’s and women’s singles draw and a 16 team men’s and women’s doubles draw. There will be a sign-up qualification tournament ahead of each of the three Futures. “Salma is extremely self-driven and very passionate about tennis,” Ewing said. “I grew up and played tennis during apartheid and I didn’t have many opportunities but I was a top junior when I left for the US in 1989 on a tennis scholarship,” she said. Salma said that the last few days has been exhausting, “I feel fine, just very tired,” she said. The 17 year old said that she is enjoying her visit to Cape Town, “It’s really cool seeing where my mom grew up,” she said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
