The baby,  believed to be between two or three weeks old, was seen on CCTV cameras being dropped by a woman believed to be his mother.  The baby was named Alexander, after Alexander the Great, and was taken to the Red Cross War Memorial Children’s Hospital where doctors gave him the all clear.  He was then taken to the Lansdowne police station where cleaner Carmen Parsons took care of him. “He was my second baby here. About nine years ago I took care of a baby girl that was found in a plastic bag.” Parsons said he was a very sweet baby and gave her no hassles.  “He didn’t even cry only when I was bathing him, but he kept quiet when I put him in the water. It is very nice to look after the baby, especially if their parents don’t want him.”  She said she sometimes wonders about the children that she looks after.  “After the first one, I asked the communication lady a few years later if she has any information on her and she didn’t.  “Hopefully with this one I will get to hear about how he grows up and stuff.” Police spokesperson Sinathi Joni confirmed that the baby was found and said “the circumstances surrounding the incident are being investigated”. The baby was taken to a place of safety in Heideveld.  Ward councillor for the area Mark Kleinschmidt said the baby was found by the family and neighbourhood watch, who alerted the police.  “A  woman was noticed in the video camera walking down St Josephs Road in Lansdowne, she must have been looking for a house that looked affluent and that is where she left him.” He said the baby was named after Alexander the Great by the paramedic who was first on the
