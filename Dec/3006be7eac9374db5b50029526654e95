“On Friday, at approximately 12.40pm, members of Steenberg police responded to shooting incidents in Choir Street,” said Steenberg police spokesperson André Traut.  “They were informed that five people were shot.  “It is alleged that a Bantam bakkie with an unknown registration number drove down the road and fired at people in the street and sped off.” Traut said the circumstances were still being investigated and no arrests had been made. Among those who sustained gun wounds was a 5-year-old boy.  Its understood that the victims were standing outside a shop when an unknown number of gunmen in the vehicle opened fire. “The 5-year-old boy was in a serious condition while the remaining four sustained minor to moderate injuries,” said ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring.  “Paramedics treated the patients and provided the seriously injured boy with advanced life support interventions before they were transported to nearby hospitals.” This is not the first time shootings have broken out in Steenberg.  The area experienced some of its worst violence last month.  A man was shot in Joe Marks Avenue. The 31-year-old was fatally wounded.  A spate of other murders and attempted murders also broke out last month in Steenberg, Lavender Hill and Retreat.  A man was killed in Retreat and one was wounded.  In Lavender Hill a man was shot dead and another wounded, and in Steenberg a man’s body was found.  He had been shot several times.    marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
