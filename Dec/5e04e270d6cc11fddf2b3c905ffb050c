Writing in this newspaper (December 15) he attacks the “Israel lobby” (read Jews) insinuating that that “lobby” did nothing in the struggle against apartheid. He is probably too young to know just how many Israel lobbyists were active in the Struggle. Esack simply has to read what Benjamin Pogrund has to say about Israeli apartheid, but this is probably too much to expect from such bigotry laced with such hatred. He talks about how boycotts and sanctions helped to bring about regime change in South Africa, but echoes the BDS call for the total destruction of Israel and not a regime change in Israel - a subtle difference. Esack sees only one victim in this struggle and ignores the history and roots of this conflict. He ignores the three major wars of annihilation of the Jewish population perpetrated by the surrounding Arab states. Perhaps this is the prof’s way of deflecting the true apartheid practices of the disastrous Arab world. He has yet to condemn that of Lebanon against their Palestinian population. When is he going to put the Middle East in perspective? * Allan Wolman, Rosebank. ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers. Cape Argus
