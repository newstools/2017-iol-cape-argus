Last week the manufacturer of the drink, Distell confirmed they were experiencing a shortage, as a result of the drought.  Distell spokesperson Dennis Matsane said the supply constraints were due to the water crisis  experienced across the Western Cape. “This has forced us to suspend bottling on our keg line, due to significant water pressure reduction as well as the need to reduce water consumption.” He said it was too early to determine the extent of the financial implications the shortage will have on the 
company.  “Our immediate focus is to keep any supply disruptions to a minimum. We do anticipate draught supply will be fully restored only early next year given the protracted nature of the drought in the Western Cape.” Manager of popular bar Stones in Long Street, Tania Knotze, said they have experienced a shortage of the beverage for over a month. “It is one of the drinks that customers prefer. They (customers) do understand, though, that it is because of the water shortage, so they are not really complaining.”  Knotze said they were notified their stock would be restored in March, despite Matsane saying that the supply had been normalised last week, “following the installation of a pressure booster system at our Green Park site.  “We are now engaging our customers to ensure that any previous stock-outs are addressed.” MEC for Local Government, Environmental Affairs and Development Planning Anton Bredell says the ongoing drought remained a pressing concern. “We see areas like Beaufort West continuing to struggle with surface water, which dried up a few months ago.  “The central Karoo has been a critical area for some time. The province has over the past few years installed boreholes and water supply systems to ensure communities do not run out of water.”    yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
