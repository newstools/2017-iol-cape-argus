More than half a century since the first performance in 1959, the Fugard Theatre’s production of this iconic musical has received five-star reviews and rapturous responses such as “a knock-out success”, “simply magnificent” and “a tribute to South Africa’s performance arts legacy”. King Kong tells the story of heavyweight 1950s boxing champion Ezekiel Dlamini to the exhilarating music of Todd Matshikiza. A live nine-piece band, under the direction of Sipumzo Trueman Lucwaba, accompanies the action at every performance. The show runs from December 12, Tuesday to Saturdays at 8pm, with a matinée at 3pm on Saturdays and on Sundays at 4pm. On New Year’s Eve, there will be a performance at 2pm and the Fugard Theatre bar will close at 7.30pm. Tickets cost from R130 to R280. Booking can be made at Webtickets www.webtickets.co.za and through the Fugard Theatre Box office on 0214614554. Cape Argus
