Last Friday, The Book Lounge celebrated its 10th anniversary. This well-loved landmark in Roeland Street has fondly been referred to as “a gem” by locals and visitors alike, and a “must-do” when touring the city. Small wonder, as this warm and welcoming place has about 8 500 books on its well-stocked shelves, of which more than 1 800 are children’s books. Regulars will know that, aside from the joy of browsing and sitting in a comfy leather armchair or couch, the book launches are a great opportunity to meet fellow book-worms. As Megan Hitchin of the Book Lounge, says: “Our drive in this is to provide a space for sharing thoughts and opinions with like-minded people. It is a space where one can speak safely, and speak truth to power.” While she says it’s impossible to say how many people have passed through its doors, “it has been, and still is, immensely rewarding to see the response to the shop, and to what we do - curating a stock profile of books that mean something to everyone who works here ” Find out more on their facebook page or  www.booklounge.co.za about their opening hours and book launches - that is, if you don’t know already.
