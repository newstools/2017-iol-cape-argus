Award-winning music group Black Motion are reportedly seeking legal advice after an alleged racist incident on-board a British Airways plane on Monday. Thabo "Smol" Mabogwane and Bongani "Murdah" Mohosana, who were on a flight from Cape Town destined for Johannesburg, were reportedly singled out and asked to from their business class seats to accommodate another passenger who complained that her seat was broken.  After a heated exchange between the air hostess, the 'Imali' hitmakers were allegedly told the captain was having them removed to avoid a "911" situation. The music duo took to social media to share their experience with fans.  The post read: "Black Motion happened to be the only two black men in the British airline business class  #Capetown, we are the victims of bad treatment. "We were embarrassed and asked to move from our seats just because a white lady complained about her seat being broken... Our image has been compromised..."
