While there are plenty of streetside establishments where you can find a plethora of flavours and cultural influences, it’s rare that you’ll find a truly eclectic mix on offer in one place outside of specialised markets. If that’s what you’re looking for, the Mojo Market in Sea Point is just for you. Located in a revitalised warehouse-style building on Sea Point’s Main Road, you’ll find a smorgasbord of foods to cater to every taste. There’s a rib shack, a burger joint, a Banting-friendly eatery, Dutch food specialist, every kind of Asian food, Mexican delights, waffles, Hungarian cured meats and some of the best ramen you can find in Cape Town. It’s all set in an indoor market interspersed with bars, plenty of seating and quaint shops selling everything from haute couture to tierlantyntjies. There’s live music to add to the atmosphere and the prices aren’t bad either. It’s the perfect pit stop if you’re taking a sunset stroll along the Sea Point Promenade, especially if you’re keen to get out of the heat. The Mojo Market truly has something for every taste. Vendors accept cash, cards and mobile payment methods like SnapScan to make shopping and buying a cinch. One of the best parts about the food available at the market is that it’s all on display, so you know exactly what to expect when you order (there’s nothing worse than order-envy in a place like this). It’s a culinary trip around the world with plenty to browse around while you graze.  lance.witten@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
