The city’s more than 1.2million households (according to the 2016 Community Survey) could be four months away from getting their water at collection points in small tanks under the watchful eyes of soldiers. Mayor Patricia de Lille said the high-water usage by residents over the past week has brought Day Zero to April 29. Day Zero, initially set for May, is the day that almost all the taps in the city will be turned off and people will have to queue for water at about 200 sites across the peninsula. Although some essential services suh as hospitals will stay connected, almost all residential suburbs will be cut-off. “Total storage has fallen 1,1%. As of this week, dam levels stand at 33%. "The City’s overall water usage rose to 641million litres per day. As of today, only 34% of residents are saving water. Agricultural users also consumed water at a similar rate to the city,” De Lille said. Holidaymakers have been using more water to stay cool in the heat and tourists have added an extra burden. Evaporation as a result of the hotter temperatures has also caused problems. Peter Flower, the City’s director for water and sanitation, said: “If water consumption continues to rise, together with the very hot windy conditions which increase evaporation losses, we can expect Day Zero to happen as soon as March 8. "This is a terrifying prospect. "Residential customers remain the largest portion of water users. If we can bring consumption down to 500million litres per day, we will be able to avoid Day Zero.” De Lille said the City’s teams would be working throughout the festive season to ensure response time to leaks or burst pipes was under two hours.  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
