Michael Jacobs who is also a former member of the Mitchells Plain CPF, said due to gender-based violence being so rife in disadvantaged communities, the organisations played a major role. CPFs encourage people to report crimes to the police’s Family Violence and Sexual Offences Unit.  “This unit specifically investigates rape and sexual crimes.  “The people who work in the victim empowerment programmes also do great work. The ones situated at the Strandfontein, Lentegeur and Mitchells Plain police stations are great. The CPFs usually refer people to these programmes when they report cases to the police stations.  “But we need the CPFs and the provincial department of social development to work together.  "There is still a huge lack of social workers in communities as it impacts on the dealing of sexual violence in our communities. The areas in Mitchells Plain with the most cases of sexual violence are Tafelsig, Beacon Valley and Eastridge,” he said. Jacobs said what had become prevalent in the area was young children, between two and three years old, playing outside in the streets until very late at night. “More kids are also hanging out in the Town Centre. You will find kids between the ages of six and nine years old staying on the streets.  “I tried taking them home and they told me there is no food at home and it is the reason why they are begging. By staying on the streets their lives are also in danger.  “This is a huge concern and we need to address the problem. We need more social auxiliary workers where there are no social workers. This will help us to address the social problems we have in our communities,” he said.
