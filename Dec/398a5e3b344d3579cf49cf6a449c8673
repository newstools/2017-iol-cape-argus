Cape Town - Rachel Petersen, 42, who is a manager at the Saartjie Baartman Centre for Abused Women and Children in Surrey Estate, told her story for the first time. She said the abuse was so bad, she bought rat poison one day, to end her and her children’s lives. The fist time she reported the abuse was during the second year of her marriage. But at the police station she was told to go back home and that it was a family matter. She described the abuse as brutal. RELATED:#DontLookAway: Violence against women is at crisis point in SA “He was cutting me with blades and hitting me with a hammer on my knees. He did this so that I could not leave the house. I was not allowed to have friends or visit my family. I was also financially dependent on him. When he used drugs and alcohol, the abuse was at its worst. "But the turning point came when I told him about a family member who was molesting our three-year-old daughter. That day I got the most severe beating. On that day I told him I was going to the shop, but we never returned to the house,” she said. Instead Petersen bought rat poison and took her two young kids with her to a nearby field. “But I realised what was happening was not their fault. I immediately threw the Rattex away. We walked to the Athlone police station. Later the police took me to a shelter and this is where I attended a workshop about abuse. "It made a huge difference in my life. I later divorced him,” she said. Petersen advised other women who are in abusive relationships to seek help at organisations that deal with violence and abuse. “Women must realise that they don’t need to stay in abusive relationships. There is help out there for them,” she said. For 16 Days of Activism to end violence against women and children, Independent Media will bring you stories behind the statistics. Please DONT LOOK AWAY.
