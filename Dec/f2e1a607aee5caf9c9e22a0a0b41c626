Cape Town - The annual switching on of the Festive Season lights has become a highlight on Cape Town's calendar and this year was no different. The City of Cape Town put on quite a show, with Idols winner Paxton Fielies, African Dream hitmaker Vicky Sampson and Voice winner Craig Lucas all performing at the free public concert on the Grand Parade opposite City Hall. Pop sensation Jimmy Nevis was also on the list of performers as were the characters of comedy theatre sensation Joe Barber. Stalls selling everything from Christmas gifts to food and drinks were available to the thousands of revellers who came out to the annual event. “The highlight of my year is always the switching on of the lights. Look at this, the diversity of Cape Town. You see Capetonians coming together - there is no one in this world that can party like us,” Mayor Patricia De Lille said.  “We must always acknowledge that each and everyone of us in this City has played a role to build this beautiful City, I also want to remind Capetonians that we still have a long way to go,” she said. The winner of the City of Cape Town’s second festive lights music challenge, rapper, singer and songwriter, Nyota Parker, also wowed the crowd with her talent.  “I was very excited when I got the phonecall and I was very excited to showcase hip hop to Cape Town,” she said. Voice SA heartthrob Craig Lucas said that a few months ago he would never have imagined performing like this.  “Performing on a stage still scares me but if someone had to tell me I would be performing at the festival I probably would’ve said they crazy,” he said.    marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
