Untu general secretary Steve Harris said the union would declare a dispute to force the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa (Prasa) to restore safety regulations on trains in the Western Cape, which contributed to train delays. “Prasa suspended several Untu  train drivers, who refused to work on the notoriously dangerous Central Line between Khayelitsha and Cape Town, but availed themselves for service on other routes,” he said. Harris said drivers reported to the union that more tracks on the central line were dysfunctional, after the service was reinstated on Wednesday after the brief suspension of the railway line. He added that a driver was quoted as saying: “We are worse off and it is more dangerous now than before the service was suspended.” Harris called on Prasa to restore rules and regulations. According to the rules, a normal train is supposed to have three motorcars, but now there are only two. “Instead of having a motorcar in the middle and one on either side, trains now have only two. But they are expected to carry the same load of people. This affects the motorcar, or the switch which will die out, and the train gets stuck in the middle of stations,” he said. This created pressure on drivers and increased safety risks. At the weekend, Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker visited the Netreg Bonteheuwel area to launch the annual joint safety campaign. He said recent events reinforced the need for constant vigilance against criminals and “the protection of critical infrastructure will be prioritised”. Meanwhile, the City of Cape Town announced it would be hosting a rail summit early next year. Cape Chamber of Commerce president Janine Myburgh said: “We need to engage with national government for taking over commuter rail... we are facing a real risk that (it) could collapse before this happens.”  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
