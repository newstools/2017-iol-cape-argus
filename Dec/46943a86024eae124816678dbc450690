Anathi Fodo is a natural who began his magical studies this year at the College of Magic and ended his first year by winning the Colin Marshall Memorial Trophy at the Artscape Theatre. His proud mother Sosikuyo Fodo said Anathi was selected and mentored after he was seen juggling at his previous school. “I never thought he would be a magician. When I saw how he was passionate about juggling I convinced my husband to allow him to study at the College of Magic. Him winning trophies proves he is serious about it and we have to support him.” Parents, pupils and guests at the College of Magic’s 2017 annual graduation ceremony at St Anne’s Primary in Plumstead were enthralled by his act last month. Each year, the College of Magic, based in Claremont, honours its exemplary pupils at two graduation ceremonies. Director of the College of Magic David Gore said Anathi keeps on impressing them, as he can now balance as many as three balls and clubs for long stretches of time. “When he enrolled in January it was quickly apparent that he had an innate ability for juggling. We have then seen him grow from strength to strength. “He is very shy, but when he is on stage balancing balls and clubs in the air, he lights up. Studying magic is helping this little guy realise his dreams.” Anathi said he couldn’t believe how much he has learnt and couldn’t wait to share his cool new tricks with our friends and family. “Juggling is a difficult performance method to learn, but when I am out there balancing my props in the air, it makes me so happy. I spend most of my time practising and it is wonderful to be recognised for how hard I work at this art.”  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
