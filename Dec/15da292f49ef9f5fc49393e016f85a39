“So often we overthink how to host events and extravagant amounts get spent putting these events together, whether it be decor, food or entertainment. My initial thought was just to have a cake and afternoon tea with a talk and it ended up being this big event with amazing support from ordinary South Africans donating within their means.”  Samodien added that the high-tea event was to honour the elderly living in Blikkiesdorp as a Christmas blessing.  “I decided to host this event three weeks ago to honour my father-in-law, who is currently fighting the Big C (Cancer). At Christmas so much gets done for the children and often the elderly are forgotten. People focus on old-age homes and don't venture into settlement areas where so many elderly are living alone and have no one at this time of the year,” she said. The initiative is set to reach people in Blikkiesdorp, Delft and surrounding areas throughout the year. To make the first event successful, gift packs were donated by Cause we can,  100 yummy meals by Dare 2 share, 100 happy tummy rice packs by Table View Angels, cakes, sweets and refreshments, toiletry packs and vitamins from various other volunteers.    If you wish to assist with future events visit Think Yellow Projects Cape Town on Facebook or e-mail: thinkyellowprojects@gmail.com  “So often people think that their donations are too small and insignificant, but we are all normal working-class people who have small means but a big difference can be made when we team up.”  Cape Argus
