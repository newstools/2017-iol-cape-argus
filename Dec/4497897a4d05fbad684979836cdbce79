He said globally there is a long waiting list for donors. “Those who are on waiting lists do better because they keep themselves healthy and do their best - to be able to get a transplant.” Calligaro said the patient in question was only on the waiting list for a week. “In lung transplants sizing is very important. You cannot take lungs from a 1.8m tall rugby player and give them to a 1.5m woman, for instance.” Pennel said the team experienced a delay during the surgery, which started at 10am and finished at about 4pm. “There had to be co-ordination between the teams at the separate hospitals. The lungs were at another hospital, so we had to co-ordinate. The patient was wheeled into the theatre around 8am and we started at 10am and there were some waiting periods in between and we finally left around 4 in the afternoon. “The lungs themselves, for the right one, there was about an hour delay from the time it was removed until they got blood supply.” The hospital’s chief executive, Dr Bhavna Patel, said it was elated that history was repeated at the hospital. “The hospital is extremely proud of this achievement as it continues to remain at the cutting edge of clinical care offered to patients and is committed to improvement through innovations such as this.” Health MEC Nomafrench Mbombo congratulated the team on Thursday. “I couldn’t be more proud of our entire Groote Schuur Hospital team. Indeed, this hospital continues to do outstanding work. "This happened a few days after we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the first heart transplant performed in the same hospital. "This goes to show that our clinicians go over and above their call of duty to save the lives of our patients."  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
