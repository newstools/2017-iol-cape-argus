There are only 105 days of usable water left if people in Cape Town continue to consume water at the current rate. As of yesterday dam levels have dropped to 30%, which is 1.5 percentage points down from a week ago. With the last 10% of a dam’s water mostly not being usable, dam levels are effectively at about 20%. However, consumption has continued to decline and is now at 751 million litres a day – 51 million litres above the collective usage target of 700 million litres a day. The City of Cape Town said that despite efforts by some residents to use water sparingly, “it remains crunch time and reductions are vital as the draw-down rate of the dams stays pronounced”. “The City has also been testing further pressure reduction initiatives to reduce consumption,” it said in a statement. The City would be deploying “a basket of consumption reduction interventions”. Full story in the Cape Argus
