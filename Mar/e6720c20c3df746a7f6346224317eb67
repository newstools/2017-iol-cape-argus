Cape Town – About 5 000 victims of the Imizamo Yethu fires, which destroyed many shacks, received basic necessities from the Thula Thula organisation. Thula Thula, a volunteer-run relief organisation, held a third fire relief day at the astroturf soccer field in Hout Bay on Tuesday to distribute clothing, toiletries, baby essentials and blankets to people who had yet to receive relief. The fire that tore through the settlement of Imizamo Yethu on Saturday, March 11, left around 15 000 people homeless. In the past week Thula Thula registered the details of 14 831 victims, and hosted two fire relief days for 9 075 people who lost their homes and possessions in the devastating fire. Thula Thula’s spokesperson Casey B Dolan said the magnitude of the fire had been a surprise. “We are trying to do everything we can to restore the residents’ dignity. We provided them with what we could.” Managing director at Baitul Ansaar in Mitchell’s Plain, Bushra Razack, brought along five children from the centre to help the residents. “We deal with a number of orphans and neglected children. We wanted to show these children that even though they also do not have anything, they can play a role in helping others.” Bulelwa Kutana, 36, a beneficiary of the Thula Thula initiative, said she was at a loss for words. “I am very happy, I do not even know what to say. I really needed all that I received today.” Cape Argus
