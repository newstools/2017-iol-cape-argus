Cape Town - When pianist Reggie Dreyer, 74, makes his debut with the Cape Town Philharmonic Orchestra at Artscape on Tuesday, he will play his favourite Mozart concerto, because that is all he wants to do.In 1960, Dreyer auditioned with the Cape Town Symphony orchestra and was accepted to play as a concert pianist, but the apartheid government denied him the chance because of the colour of his skin.Unmarked by bitterness and rage, Dreyer said on Monday: It was a disappointing time in my life, it wasn t a good thing, but you don t go and sit, moaning, groaning and blaming it all on apartheid. I had to get on with my life; there was so much to do. Now, I just want to play this concerto, that s all I want to do. Yes, I was disadvantaged but just let me play, added Dreyer, who will play the first movement of the Mozart Piano Concerto No 23 in A, K488, at the concert.About his debut on Tuesday, Dreyer said: It means a great deal to me. This concerto, introduced to me by my piano teacher Miss Ivy Parkin, is the same one that I auditioned with all those years ago. It has always been with me, I still feel so strongly that this is what I want to play. In the intervening years, as a music teacher at primary, high school and college level, Dreyer said he had led a full life with his family and his church. Church music has always been my main occupation. I play organ and I am the choir master at the Diep River Methodist Church. I also compose hymns, school songs and jazz pieces. I play jazz as I want to keep that part of my musical traditions alive in me. I m not a full-time jazz musician and don t play gigs. Cheering Dreyer on will be his wife Mattie, his siblings, friends and his daughter Lynne Connolly, who flew in from London. I m so proud of Dad. It is why I am here. I ll be there as his groupie.
