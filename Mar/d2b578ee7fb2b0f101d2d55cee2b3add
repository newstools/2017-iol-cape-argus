Three days after the fire destroyed over 3 500 homes DARG staff and volunteers confirmed that they have collected at least 96 animals – 30 cats and 66 dogs. DARG facilitator Ryno Engelbrecht said at least 11 animals had died in the fire. “We go in every day to bring the people water. The dog owners then give us their animals to look after until their homes have been rebuilt." “Along our patrols we have found a lot of injured animals which we care for there or take to the vet for treatment.” One of the injured animals was a dog named Blackie Blacks whose entire body fur was singed. He is just one of the the nine dogs and three cats who had been injured in the fire. “There are still a lot more animals that scattered in the fire and might go back to the area in the next few days. Once we arrive with the animals at the centre we place them in cages. “We feed them, give them water and then examine the animals for any injuries, “ said Engelbrecht. Animals taken in by DARG are either housed at the centre, taken to the Cape of Good Hope SPCA or are fostered to other Hout Bay residents who are willing to help. Alan Perrins, chief executive of the Cape of Good Hope SPCA , confirmed that they had taken in at least 33 animals by on Sunday afternoon. Tanya Kohlberg, a Hout Bay resident, is among the many people who have gone to the DARG facility to make donations.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
