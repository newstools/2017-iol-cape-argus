Among those left with extensive burns was a cat named Amara, which was rescued by the Animal Welfare Society after a phone call by the owner. Angelique Stanbridge, the inspector at the shelter, said: “On Sunday I received a call from the owner of the cat. She was in a lot of  distress and told me that the cat was burnt.” When Stanbridge arrived in the area on Sunday night, she saw that the cat was suffering from severe wounds, including blistered paws. The cat is currently being treated by the Animal Welfare Society, cared for 24/7 and given special medication. The Bonteheuwel fire broke out on Saturday around 11pm, and eight structures were gutted. The 18-month-old-baby remains in hospital and has extensive burns on the face and arms. She is now the only fire victim still in hospital. “We started cleaning up some of the fire damage yesterday and we are still continuing to clean up," said ward councillor Angus McKenzie. "It’s quite a lot of damage.” He added that the 33 people who had been left without shelter were sleeping in the community centre. Cape Argus
