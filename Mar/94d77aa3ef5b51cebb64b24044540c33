Cape Town - The government is “urgently” seeking a permanent solution to the “humanitarian disaster” which occurs annually as a result of fires that rage through the informal settlement parts of Imizamo Yethu in Hout Bay. The City of Cape Town confirmed that the cost of the provision of fire kits to registered “fire-affected beneficiaries” could rise to more than R100 million. The registration of beneficiaries has been checked against a recent survey of the settlement conducted by the city’s Informal Settlements Management Department, said acting mayor Ian Neilson. The fire, which swept through Dontse-Yakhe in Imizamo Yethu on Saturday, killing four people and leaving 2 200 families (7 300 people) destitute, was described by relief workers as the worst fire disaster experienced in the settlement. On Thursday, Mayco member for safety and security JP Smith said: “The Department of Home Affairs will be on site over the next few days to assist with the replacement of identity documents. “Unfortunately individuals who lost driving licences will need to reapply.” Cape Argus
