The Atlantis bus driver, a father of five and grandfather of five, started cycling at the age of 18 as a way to keep fit and healthy. “I am glad to have been doing this for so many years because staying fit is good for my health and it keeps the doctor away, especially at my age. “I also run and have won athlete of the year for three consecutive years at the Atlantis Athletics Club,” he says. Crozier’s father was a truck driver and he remembers driving around with his dad. “I used to do it in order to spend time with my dad, not knowing that I would be a bus driver.” He has driven for Golden Arrow Bus Service for 31 years and has enjoyed every minute of it. None of his children or grandchildren are interested in cycling, but they do run with him at times. He used to cycle competitively and clocked a number of sub three-hour races. He now cycles for the sheer enjoyment of taking in the breathtaking scenery of Cape Town. “I have not had enough training because they only told me last month that I can participate. I had forgotten I was part of the VIP group,” he says. “Luckily for me I run long distances every weekend, so I think I will manage with this year’s event.” Cape Argus
