Cape Town – The decision by the Western Cape High Court to allow video clips of the Henri van Breda murder trial has been suspended. Murder-accused Van Breda, 22, was set to stand trial on Monday after his parents and brother were found brutally killed in their luxury De Zalze estate home in Stellenbosch in January 2015. Judge Siraj Desai had initially allowed the media to broadcast clips from the trial, except for the testimony of Marli van Breda – the only other survivor of the gruesome attack. An applicaiton had been made by a media house to broadcast recorded clips of the trial. However, Van Breda's lawyer, Pieter Botha questioned the decision and requested leave to appeal Judge Desai's ruling. “The applicants knew trial would be on the 27th March. They procrastinated and waited till the eleventh hour. We understand (the) media is anxious, but there are fair trial rights. It is because of them that we are in this position,” said Botha. State prosecutor Hilton Epstein agreed that fair trial rights must prevail.  Desai questioned both arguments. “There is no real prospect of jeopardy. We live in a society that’s more open than before. Some people's thumbs work faster than the message can be relayed on television,” said Desai. Desai then suspended his initial decision. It is believed there would be a postponement in the criminal matter once the case resumes on Monday afternoon. Van Breda is accused of murdering his mother, Teresa, father, Martin, and brother, Rudi, in January 2015. He also faces a charge of attempted murder. He handed himself over to the police in June 2016. He is currently out on R100 000 bail.
