The “Tour of Light” has become an annual ride since 2015 and 11 cyclists are hoping to raise awareness and money for Cansa. The cyclists pedalled through Bloemfontein, Colesberg, Richmond, Beaufort 
West and Matjiesfontein and will stop in Paarl on Friday morning before heading to Cape Town. “We previously cycled for leukemia, but  wanted to spread out and reach more people affected by cancer, the patients and the caregivers,” said Cecilia Hiemstra, who has taken part in all the previous rides. “Cycling through Bloemfontein, we visited a Cansa care centre. Most people who stay over are from the rural areas and many don’t speak English. We had dinner with them. It's important to spread hope. “It’s an adventure reaching out to people on the way. South Africans need to reach out to each other when experiencing life-affecting diseases, especially cancer.” Hiemstra said that when they left Paarl, the team would meet the deputy mayor of Cape Town, who would cycle with them for 5km.
