Curator Khanyisile Mbongwa said the performances signified the intersection between religion, tradition and aspects of modernity. The second performance, called Ingcibi, reflected on the challenges of social structures. “The works are generally around the intersection between colonial religion and African tradition. How one has to exist in this double consciousness as a black body.” The women and men utilised blankets, while they expressed anguish and sorrow. “It means finding spaces that appear to be hidden... people come into the city every day for work purposes to negotiate their livelihood.” The first performance by Indoni Dance, Arts & Leadership Academy incorporated gumboot dance, filled with high energy. Curator Leila Anderson said it was informative and exciting for artists to work in public spaces. Moving Stories Theatre founder Aphiwe Mpahleni executed the choreography for Ingcibi. Residents from Khayelitsha, Nyanga and Langa came to Moving Stories Theatre in Woodstock to pursue their love for art and dance. The Infecting the City public art festival is showing from April 5 to 8 in and around the Cape Town CBD.  matthew.vanschalkwyk@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
