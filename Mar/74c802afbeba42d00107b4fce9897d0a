Cape Town Since 2012 there have been more than 230 attacks on paramedics across both the private and public health sectors in the Western Cape alone, according to ER24. It has become increasingly difficult for paramedics to save lives when there are not enough police vehicles to escort us. We queue for up to an hour waiting for police to respond, Melomed s operations manager Salama Joseph said.Paramedics are not only being attacked in red zone areas, Joseph said. Earlier this year an attempted hijacking took place in Athlone where a Melomed 24 ambulance windscreen was smashed in on Petunia Road in Silvertown. Our assaults fall on deaf ears how can the government expect the community to help us when that will only endanger their own lives? Police escort us into the red zone areas and quickly retreat while we are busy attending to the patient. Former paramedic Sakeenah Abrahams gave up on her calling because it simply became too dangerous. My main reason for seeking alternate employment was the danger out there. Six years ago it wasn t this bad; I wasn t fearful at all and communities protected the guys in uniform.&quot; However, over the past few years it has become scary. The EMSHE (Emergency Medical Support in Hostile situations) course is very beneficial and comes in handy, Abrahams said, but due to the cost related to the course not many services offer it to their paramedics. Debriefing, trauma-counselling and leave from work is not enough in aiding paramedics after assaults; the only way we ll feel safe is if we are being properly protected, said Joseph. The methods of support need to be reassessed by the Western Cape Health Department and SAPS. Abrahams also said there is too little police visibility in the red zone areas and no community is safe in South Africa.Cape Argus
