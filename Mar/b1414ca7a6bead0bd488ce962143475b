Cape Town – Disciplinary proceedings against DA ward 54 councillor Shayne Ramsay are yet to get under way, nearly four months after she caused an uproar on social media in a post slating homeless people. Ramsay’s Facebook post in November, which she quickly deleted following a public outcry, classed the homeless in three categories: Criminals (who she said were “in and out of overcrowded prisons”), mentally retarded or social outcasts, and those “generally down on their luck”. In the rant, Ramsay called for a march against the “vagrants” in Sea Point, saying the homeless “rely on our handouts for their existence”. “Our garbage bins are treated as buffet table... if you stop giving to the beggars, street people and car guards, they will move elsewhere,” she wrote. “Given that we have such a liberal constitution, there’s not much the SAPS can do to control vagrants. So my next task is to review the ‘Streets and Public Places’ by-law and make recommendations to council to tighten up laws where appropriate.” The post was condemned by DA chief whip Shaun August, who said he had asked Ramsay to withdraw it and apologise. “I will investigate and deal with her if there’s any transgression in terms of DA rules,” he said. Council speaker Dirk Smit said on Sunday the matter had finally been referred to the disciplinary committee. Ramsay then informed her followers “the march planned is cancelled” adding “I unreservedly apologise to everyone I offended, particularly the homeless South Africans in Cape Town. I would like to state my post is not a reflection of the values of the City of Cape Town or the party I represent, the DA. I believe we have to create jobs and equip homeless residents with skills.” Cape Argus
