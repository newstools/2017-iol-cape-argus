Pupils and parents at the Solomon Qatyana Primary School in Strand locked the principal and the department inspector in a school toilet to teach them a lesson about the condition of the foul smelling toilets, which they had been complaining about. There was chaos at the school as parents, teachers and pupils marched outside the school against alleged overcrowding, no proper school structure, no sports grounds and no proper school ground. The pupils missed a day of schooling. Parents said there had been promises made to built a new school, which had not been kept. Councillor for the area Semthembile Mfelane said he supported what the parents and pupils did because they had been complaining for a long time. “Solomon Qatyana is the first mobile school in Strand with over 1 000 pupils. We have been asking for a proper structure for years now. Other schools which came after this school have proper structures.” Vuyiseka Malawana, 37, mother of a Grade 6 pupil, said she was worried about the health of her children as they were sharing toilets with adults and the toilets were dirty and smelly. “We decided to lock them inside the bathroom because we felt they were not taking us seriously. They don’t have children at that school so they don’t care about our children’s health," she said. “On hot days it is difficult for pupils to concentrate because of the lack of ventilation.” Police eventually arrived and asked parents to unlock the toilet and release the principal and inspector, which they did. Discussions with parents were held.
