Cape Town – It is the final countdown to the Cape Argus SportShow this weekend. Sandringham is set to host the three-day sporting showcase that includes sporting celebs, clinics, exhibitors and live performances. One of the most exciting aspects of the SportShow is the opportunity to sit down and learn from the professionals what motivates them, and how they pushed through various challenges on to success. Extreme Speaker Box will allow attendees to learn more about some of their favourite personalities, with this year’s speaker being world famous adventurers Riaan Manser and Vasti Geldenhuys. Riaan Manser is a pioneering explorer, and was the first person to circumnavigate the coast of Africa by bicycle, a distance of 37000 km, through 34 countries over two years and two months. In July 2009 he became the first person to kayak 5 000 km around Madagascar, alone and unaided. Both journeys were covered in his books, Around Africa on My Bicycle and Around Madagascar on my Kayak. His most recent journey, “Take Me 2 New York” started in December 2013 with his long-time girlfriend, Vasti Geldenhuys where they rowed from Morocco, Africa to New York City, USA in an ocean rowing boat alone and unaided. It promises to be an exciting talk where attendees can learn why some people thrive and what motivates winners to peak performance. The SportShow will also offer BOUNCE’s Extreme Team showing off some slick and exciting tricks on a trampoline and also a few parkour moves. The young BOUNCE enthusiasts will defy the rules of gravity in a trampoline showcase never seen before as they take on the Great Wall and slam dunk like basketball professionals while mixing it up with the BOUNCE parkour and dancing crew. Tickets for the event are available at the SportShow site (www.sportshow.co.za) and Computicket. Gates are open from 9am to 6pm throughout the weekend. Entrance cost R150 (adults), R80 (children) and R200 for a weekend pass. Toddlers under 3 enter free. Cape Argus
