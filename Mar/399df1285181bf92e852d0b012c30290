Parts of Kuils River and Bellville will be without water between 7pm on Thursday and 7am on Friday. The City of Cape Town issued the alert due to maintenance and urgent repairs would be done on a leaking valve on the Streenbras pipeline. Some areas may also experience a drop in water pressure. Businesses are urged to ensure their holding and storage tanks are filled to meet daily operational needs. Residents are also urged to store enough water for domestic use. Water tankers will be stationed at the Caltex garage next to Ferndale Delta for public use. Residents of these areas are also urged to ensure their taps are tightly shut to ensure there is no wastage or damage once the supply is restored. "The City apologises for any inconvenience caused, but it is imperative that repairs are effected to prevent further water losses," the city council said in a statement.
