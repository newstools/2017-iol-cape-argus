The partnership will see SMTAX, one of South Africa’s leading online tax and advisory firms, providing Silulo Ulutho Technologies, a fast-growing technology and IT company, with an e-commerce business platform that will afford Silulo clients the opportunity to access business-related services efficiently and affordably. These services include new company registrations, tax clearance certificates, black economic empowerment certificates, submission of tax returns, financial statements, management of accounts and other amenities. Luvuyo Rani, managing director and founding member of Silulo Ulutho Technologies, said the firm connected the people, places, platforms and applications that mattered to the business. “In a world that is changing faster than ever, you need to leverage technology to increase efficiency, and this merger does exactly that.” Buchule Sibaca, the chief executive of SMTAX, said: “Our goal at SMTAX is to make starting and running a business as seamless as possible and to better connect our clients with the right financial information any time, anywhere and from any  device. “As a digital accounting and tax company, the partnership with Silulo Ulutho Technologies gives us the ability to empower our people through innovative online business solutions, thereby increasing the financial inclusion of previously disadvantaged Africans.” Economic Opportunities MEC Alan Winde said the partnership was an excellent example of how technology could improve the way business was done in the Western Cape. “The addition of an electronic business platform increases Silulo Ulutho Technologies’ competitive edge and is set to take the business to new heights. I would like to commend Luvuyo Rani on this innovative approach," he said. CAPE ARGUS
