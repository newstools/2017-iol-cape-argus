The proposed Princess Vlei eco-sensitive development is gaining steam, with architectural drawings nearing completion. Princess Vlei Forum chairman Philip Bam said the proposed precinct was about finding the right balance between land use planning and restoration of the environmental assets. He said architects were in the process of working on eco-sensitive designs for recreational facilities. At this stage there was no fixed cost to the project, which was expected to run into millions. “The city will bear most of the costs, but we are looking at finding corporate and other funders to make up the shortfall,” said Bam. After the initial consultation with community stakeholders, a plan was drawn up that provides for administration areas, an events area, pathways for hiking and exercise, nature appreciation, an environmental education facility, upgraded braai areas, non-motorised watersport areas and play areas. “Our first priority right now is to appeal to the city to appoint a bio-diversity manager to oversee the project,” said Bam.
