Cape Town – A Hanover Park family is struggling to come to terms with the death of a family member in a fire that destroyed three homes and left 14 people destitute. The families said the fire started in the backyard structure of one of the homes when an electricity box allegedly exploded. The flames quickly spread to the adjacent homes. Homeowner Arthur Abrahams said his brother Melcon, 48, was killed when he could not escape from a room he was sleeping in. “My brother was trapped in the room and later died outside before the ambulance came. Losing everything including my brother is heartbreaking, and frustrating. I wish I could have saved my brother.” Backyarder Sofia Weetyz said her son Justin, who is in Grade 1, was traumatised and had not returned to school because his uniform and schoolbooks were burnt in the blaze. “My child received counselling at school but he is still traumatised. I was told by the school he must go back this week Thursday, but I don’t understand how he will go because he is only left with the clothes he is wearing.” Weetyz also thanked the firefighter who tried to rescue Melcon from the burning house. Their neighbours were slightly luckier. They managed to save most of their possessions from the fire. Cape Argus
