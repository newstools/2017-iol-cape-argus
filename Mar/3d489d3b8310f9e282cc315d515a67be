Cape Town The Cape Argus SportShow is back, and it promises to be a weekend of fun for all. From March 24-26, Sandringham Farm in Stellenbosch will host the three-day sporting showcase that includes live performances, sporting celebs, clinics, exhibitors and games.Simon Robinson, chief executive of Drone Racing Africa, is eager to show those who attend the event all about drone racing. Drone racing is where we will have pilots who fly a drone, first person view (FPV) they fly as if they are in the cockpit. It s not when they are flying line of sight, but using a virtual-reality headset, Robinson said. For the SportShow we will have 20 pilots who will be flying drones that can reach up to 160km/* . He said they had been vetting applicants for selection. They would compete in three rounds, testing a variety of skills. FPV circuit racing will have four pilots racing. Then there will be a freestyle round where, for two minutes, pilots will be flying to music, and the last round is a speed round to see which drones are the fastest, Robinson said. They will all be competing for prizes worth R20 000. Robinson said drone racing would provide the best entertainment of the event, as well as provide opportunities for the public to experience it. Micro-drones, which are mini-drones that fit into the palm of your hand, allow people to fly indoors. The public will be able to come down and see how our pilots fly them, while also getting a chance to learn from the pilots, he said. We ve never had an opportunity like this to create our own event, and the only sad thing is that we can only have 20 pilots. Hopefully we will set a precedent, but it will definitely be a must-attend event for all. Cape Argus
