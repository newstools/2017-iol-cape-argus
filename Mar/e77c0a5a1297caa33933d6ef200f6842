Mat Barlett, founder of The Grind, explained that there would be a 5km race with 30 obstacles and a 10km race with 40 obstacles over the two days. “The Grind obstacle course race is Cape Town’s No 1 obstacle course and mud-run event. “The event is open to the public, with a typical one-day event attracting 1 500 athletes and 2 500 to 3 000 spectators. We specialise in fun muddy obstacle courses for everyone from little kids to weekend warriors and elite athletes,” Bartlett said. The Grind will have competitive batches of faces for the Elites, Masters and Young Guns. There are different race types for those interested in taking part in different levels of fitness. Rapid Grind has been designed with first timers in mind and is a great introduction to obstacle course racing for groups to get together and have fun on the course or individuals wanting to test their abilities. Tickets for this race cost R350. The Young Guns will provide a 5km modified obstacle race and for athletes who are under 18. The ticket price is R300 with prizes up for grabs. The Little G is a kiddies course to keep the kids entertained and ticket prices are R120. “All Grind ticket holders get free entry to the Cape Argus SportShow, so we are very excited to see new sports on display. “We have developed an event that ensures family togetherness in a wholesome fun environment. In addition, the top athletes taking part are amazing role models for young people who are still trying to find a sport they can enjoy. “We are always on the lookout for talented young people who we can sponsor to get them involved in a possible future OCR career.” The Cape Argus SportShow takes place from March 24-26 at Sandringham. *  Tickets are available at www.sportshow.co.za as well as at Computicket. Gates open 9am till 6pm throughout the weekend. Entrance costs R150 for adults, R80 for children and R200 for a weekend pass. Toddlers under 3 enter free. Cape Argus
