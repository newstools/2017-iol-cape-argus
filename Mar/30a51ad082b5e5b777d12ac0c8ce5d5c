Johannesburg – Struggle icon Ahmed Kathrada, 87, was laid to rest on Wednesday at Johannesburg’s West Park Cemetery in accordance with Muslim religious rites. Kathrada, affectionately known as “uncle Kathy”, died on Tuesday after a short illness following surgery to the brain to remove a blood clot. Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan received a standing ovation at the funeral as speakers expressed dissatisfaction with the state of the governing African National Congress (ANC) and its top leadership. Earlier, former president Kgalema Motlanthe delivered the eulogy, stirring the sombre mood in the audience as he quoted Kathrada’s open letter to President Jacob Zuma, in which the struggle icon asked Zuma to resign. Zuma did not attend the funeral after the Kathrada family requested that he stay away. “He penned a public letter to the president of our country in which he gave vent to his views about the condition of the State in which our nation finds itself. 354 days ago today, comrade Katharda wrote this letter to which a reply has not been forthcoming, as you are aware,” Motlanthe said to a loud applause and cheering from the audience. Kathrada is survived by his wife Barbara Hogan, 67, also an ANC veteran and former Cabinet minister. African News Agency
