The Delft taxi war has intensified and spilled over out of the area with a taxi being stoned in Lansdowne on the Cape Flats on Wednesday morning. The driver crashed into a Golden Arrow bus, leaving a number of his passengers injured. A taxi registered with the Congress of Democratic Taxi Association (Codeta) travelling from Wynberg to Mfuleni was stoned with bricks. The driver fled on foot. The passengers were transported to various hospitals for observations. The owner of the taxi, Mzwandile Dyantyi said: “The person called and asked whether I know that my taxi has been in an accident. I was shocked and rushed here only to find windows smashed and the entire front part of my car damaged.” Dyantyi said he suspected his taxi was targeted by members of the Cape Amalgamated Taxi Associated (Cata). He said Codeta would be meeting to discuss a way forward later today. Cata claimed on Tuesday it was being forced out of Delft by the Delft Taxi Association, and as a result it had suspended its services in both Delft and Nyanga indefinitely. Two drivers, believed to be registered with Cata, have been killed in the violence which erupted earlier in March. Cata’s Nqazeleni Matayitayi said the situation is not conducive for operating. “This has really affected the passengers. It is chaotic.” Meanwhile in Delft the local taxi association was in a meeting with the police on Wednesday morning. Police officers and City traffic officials were monitoring the situation. Delft Taxi Association’s Lunga Mzembe said the rank was closed off because there was yet another shooting on Tuesday. This brings to at least five the number of taxi-related shootings in Delft since Friday, March 10.
