Parliament – The Economic Freedom Fighters were noticeably absent from Parliament on Thursday afternoon as they boycotted President Jacob Zuma’s question and answer session. This as President Zuma returned to the National Assembly for the first time since the State of the Nation Address and subsequent debate last month. In a statement issued earlier the party said they would not be attending Thursday’s proceedings. Last year the EFF also boycotted President Zuma’s last session in Parliament saying they did not recognise him as a President after he broke his oath of office. “Jacob Zuma broke his oath of office and is occupying the highest office in the country illegitimately. Jacob Zuma is allergic to submitting to the country's constitutional authority and therefore in the same sentiment, the EFF will not subdue to the office of the President so long it is occupied by him,” says the party’s Mbuyiseni Ndlozi . “Members of Parliament of the EFF will therefore use the time to do more important things that will see to the advancement of the EFF. “Since it is the Year of the Branch, EFF MP's will prioritise the program which is much more important than adorning an illegitimate President with attention.” Political Bureau
