Backed by the All Star High School Band, Tiyane Stemmet crooned over the large crowd 
gathered for the Cape Town International Jazz Festival’s free concert. Thousands were drawn to a 
foretaste of what can be expected at the 18th edition of the musical event. Good Hope FM DJ TK said she was delighted to see so many people of all ages, and from so many different backgrounds and places, gather together because “love of music is the one thing that unites all people”. Popular Afropop group Mango Groove were the drawcard for Isobel Nyakome, 34, who fondly 
remembered seeing her favourite band when she was just 10 years old. All Star Band 2017 drummer 
Timothy Arendse and keyboard player Benjamin Lewis, both 14, from Wynberg High had to write an exam before their big night on stage, and today they will write another, said Timothy’s proud mother 
Valerie. His grandmother, also Valerie, said that her grandson began tapping out sounds with his knife and fork as a toddler - and hasn’t stopped. Meanwhile, pensioner and jazz lover Ursula Gildert from Brackenfell said she and her husband could not attend the festival this weekend because it was too expensive, so the free concert was a chance to see “what it’s all about” and “I’m just sorry I did not bring a chair”. “The sound is fantastic,” said Brendan Kensley from Muizenberg, who added that he kept returning to the annual event for the love of jazz. The audience bopped away to the sounds of the salsa rhythms of talent contest winner Danielle Jacobs of 
Manenberg, VuDu’s cool blends, and Mango Groove’s Afro-jazz. International acts En Vogue and Moreira Chonguica also had the crowd dancing. Cape Argus
