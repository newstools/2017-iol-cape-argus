Cape Town – The Western Cape Education Department has been compelled by the Cape High Court to fix the Uitsig High school “with immediate effect”. The dilapidated school has been at the centre of a row between Cosatu’s Tony Ehrenreich and the Education Department which refused to fix the school and chose to rather close it. The school has been at the brink of closure, but due to protests and lobbying of parents, it has remained open. According to the court order, the department must take steps to ensure water, electricity and proper sanitation services are installed or maintained. The court also ordered the department to provide separate toilets for male and female staff as soon as possible and to provide drinking water and toilet facilities. It must also provide two 24-hour security guards on the school premises. “It is the most important victory for the learners,” Ehrenreich, Cosatu Western Cape provincial secretary said. He said it was necessary for them go to court, given that the WCED ignored the Human Rights Commission after members paid a visit to the severely vandalised school. “The department was fully aware of the problems and now the court has ordered it to fix those problems around the school,” Ehrenreich said. He said the court victory set a good foundation going forward and he and the federation would continue to support all schools deprived by the WCED. A spokesperson said the WCED welcomed the outcome and will continue with consultation required by the SA Schools Act.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
