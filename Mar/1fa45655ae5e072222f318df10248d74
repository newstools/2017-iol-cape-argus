Cape Town – The two taxi drivers shot dead in Delft in as many days were both Cape Amalgamated Taxi Association (Cata) members, and it is unclear who is behind the murders. There are suggestions it could be illegal operaters muscling in on lucrative routes from Delft taxi rank. Cata’s Nqazeleni Matayitayi said suspicion was based on the fact that on Friday a team of operators, mandated to investigate non-licensed taxis operating on the routes, approached a suspicious-looking taxi. The driver opened fire while fleeing, shooting a man in the arm. MEC for Community Safety Dan Plato said labelling the shootings a taxi war was premature and would only spark more violence. He said the industry needed to resolve its issues as the public may stay away because they do not want to be involved in violence. Cata held a meeting with its members on Tuesday in the wake of the shootings. Chairperson Victor Wiwi said: “We do not know where these attacks on our drivers is coming from or who is behind it, we just want our members to be aware of the attacks.” Siphesihle Dube, spokesperson for Transport MEC Donald Grant, said the department would work with police to bring those responsible to justice.  siyabonga.kalipa@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
