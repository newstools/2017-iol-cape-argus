And who better to take your pride and joy to be serviced by  than professionals who have been in the business for nearly six decades? A staple for cyclists on the Cape Flats is Crown Cycles in Imam Haron Road, Lansdowne. Co-owned by brothers Gary and Hilton Cloete, the company has grown so much it needed to open a second store right next to its current premises. Gary said their shop was one of the oldest in Cape Town: “Crown Cycles came about in 1948 and was first owned by my grandfather and then my father and now by my brother and I. The store started out as a little shop and has since seen a number of people entering the shop’s doors.” Providing a full suite of servicing and sales, Crown Cycles sees a massive spike in business in Cycle Tour season. “We get a lot people wanting to service their bicycles, especially during the Cycle Tour season. People book their bicycles in as early as January to ensure that their bicycles are in good form for the race.” He said Cycle Tour season was busier than Christmas as even international people from as far as Australia, Germany and the US made their way to the stores. “The first week of March is usually the craziest time because everyone wants to use our services.” Cape Argus
