Cape Town – Providing identity documents to residents left destitute by the Imizamo Yethu fire has become as important as the provision of disaster relief and medical care. Department of Home Affairs spokesperson Mayihlome Tshwete said on Thursday the Cape Town department’s mobile teams were on standby to assist fire victims by issuing birth certificates and temporary identity documents which they can use immediately to access services. “We are working with stakeholders in the area and are just waiting on Disaster Risk Management and the Department of Human Settlements to finalise the list of those affected by the fire,” said Tshwete. Once the lists are finalised the mobile teams will be able to process the documents on-site and the department will waive application fees. Western Cape Health MEC Dr Nomafrench Mbombo said the department would identify what health-care services their private partner Cipla Foundation can provide to the community. A site for the temporary unit, which will be run by a nursing sister and an assistant, is being identified. Cipla has undertaken to donate R20 000 of medical stock and to provide personal care products, Mbombo said. Cape Argus
