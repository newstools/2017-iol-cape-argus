The One City, Many Cultures Cape Town Festival will celebrate its 19th birthday at a new venue this year. The annual Human Rights Day event will take place at the Castle of Good Hope and not the Iziko Museums/Company Gardens precinct as in previous years. The festival, which was born out of the One City, Many Cultures project, seeks to promote a greater understanding of different cultures in the Western Cape. The event will include musical and dance performances, among them salsa dancing, where members of the public will be encouraged to learn how to salsa. “As usual, we will be busing-in members of communities throughout the Cape Flats who will gain free entry to the Castle on the day. Some will come from Atlantis, Delft, Heideveld, Langa and Mitchells Plain, among others, and will also perform on the day,” said Cape Town Festival’s Ryland Fisher. The festival runs from 10am until 6pm, with a line-up of artists that includes Soli Philander, who will perform part of his one-man show, Nice Coat and All That Jazz; festival favourite Ashley Pienaar, who will host the event; and many other local artists. Social Development MEC Albert Fritz will be joined by 10 top business people and captains of industry in touring the stands of 25 young entrepreneurs from across the province who will showcase their businesses at the Human Rights Day Business Expo and Family Day at Welwitschia Primary School in Delft South. Social Development spokesperson Sihle Ngobese says the young entrepreneurs have gone on to start their own small businesses. Cosatu will hold a march against racism in Muizenberg tomorrow. Cosatu provincial secretary Tony Ehrenreich said a beach day would be held for Cosatu members and their families after the march. President Jacob Zuma will deliver the Human Rights Day keynote address at the Victoria Grounds, King William's Town, in the Eastern Cape. Cape Argus
