It's been almost a week since 13-year-old Rene Tracy Roman went missing from her Retreat home and the police are no closer to finding her. “I must just be strong,” her mother Chrissandre Jacobs said. “There’s no other thing that I can do now. I can just pray and hope and put our trust in the Lord now – that’s all we can do.” The teen was last seen last Friday afternoon around 2pm when she left her family home to go to the shop a few doors away. Concerned people and parties from Retreat are still offering their full support, she said. “They been there 100% from Friday up until now. A lot of friends, family and church people are always standing behind us as a family. “I want to thank Lucinda Evans (from the Community Police Forum) for the all help that she’s done. She’s contacted the radio, the media and coming up with the reward was her idea,” Jacobs said. A reward of R10 000 for Rene’s safe return was put up this week, raised by the Steenberg CPF. Rene’s stepfather Mervyn Jacobs said they were still desperately searching for her, and the support from the community was welcome. “All the leaders are donating the funds because they feel the urge to get our child back. Pastor Trevor Trout from a church in Capricorn donated R2 000,” he said. “We as a family appreciate what they are doing. They put their hands into their own pockets. It is just amazing how we as a community are standing together. “We just want to thank everyone for assisting us – we really appreciate it.” Cape Argus
