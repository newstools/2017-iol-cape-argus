Cape Town residents opened their hearts to the more than 15 000 people left homeless by the devastating fire in Imizamo Yethu, Hout Bay. The fire in Dontse-Yakhe Section destroyed some 3 500 homes, and left a family of three dead. In the ensuing 72 hours after the blaze was extinguished, Capetonians dropped off donations of food, clothing and other items to those who had lost everything. Last night before the light faded, convoys of volunteers were still doing the rounds to provide food and water packs to residents who had begun rebuilding their homes on the site, which had not yet been fully cleared of the burnt debris. “The Imizamo Yethu disaster relief has been the biggest one yet, but we need so much more. Packaging, boxes, masking tape,” said Thula Thula co-ordinator Jo-Anne Chemaly. She said all displaced people had registered for relief aid and would be provided with building kits consisting of corrugated zinc sheets, a door, a window and poles. As the public and corporates dropped off goods at the Thula Thula base at the Ambleside Primary School hall, it was being sorted into packages and boxes, Chemaly said. “These daylight hours are important for us to get vitally needed supplies to the people. When light fades it is dark up there." Full story in the Cape Argus
