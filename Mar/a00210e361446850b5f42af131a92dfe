At least nine people were murdered every day in the Western Cape in the first three quarters of the 2016/17 financial year. This equates to 2 481 murders between April 1 and December 31, 2016. The gloomy preliminary figures, which have been released by the SAPS, already indicate an increase of 0.7% in the provincial murder rate compared to the previous year’s statistics. The national murder rate currently stands at 52 people on average per day. It’s the first time since the mid-1990s that the police have publicly released quarterly crime reports, the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), which had long been advocating for the move, said yesterday. According to the police document, entitled the "Crime Situation in SA", the Western Cape was the fourth deadliest province after Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape.
