Cape Town Sandy Bay in Llandudno was closed on Sunday as officials from the City of Cape Town, the National Sea Rescue Institute, and the Department of Environmental Affairs responded to .Measuring about 10m in length and weighing about 10 tons, the whale did not appear to have suffered any visible injuries but was having difficulty breathing.Environmental Affairs spokesperson Gregg Oelofse said the team had tried to assess whether the animal could be saved. The whale had no visible signs of injury... must be internal or it is sick, he said. A decision was eventually taken to euthanise the whale. An assessment revealed the animal would likely beach itself again, if it was towed back into the deep sea. Once that process (euthanisation) had been concluded, the carcass would be towed to Hout Bay Harbour, where it would be taken to the landfill site at Vissershok, Oelofse said. Cape Argus
