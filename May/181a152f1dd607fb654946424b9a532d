A lone watchman stands on the rooftop of the block of tightly-packed flats, smoking, when he receives a call. He rushes down to the group of men, whispering something into the ear of the leader of the group. The leader downs his beer, stands up, cocks his pistol and heads out the door. The group follows with their firearms in hand and they climb into a parked car, apparently on a mission to kill. None of them gets into the driver's seat.   This is where the humour is supposed to kick in, as the group of apparent gangsters, willing to head out to kill, debate over who is going to drive because they are all intoxicated. They all fear taking a breathalyser test because "these days the cops are all over". And social media was having none of it.              It's trash, condescending and offensive. Stop stereotyping us coloureds in the name of preventing drunken driving https://t.co/yJRyckFelB — KenFolk (@bout_Maxine) May 11, 2017      Facebook users also had their say.     Adrian Manchest wrote: "Seriously! What is the Western Cape Government thinking?"  Allen De Reuck posted: "I think it's condescending towards coloured people who live in underprivileged areas, however it shows responsibility even from those who do wrong." Yusuf Abzal commented: "Quite disturbing. It's almost like they're telling us that it's okay go shoot people as long as you're sober. Hope it never airs on TV." Zulpha Khan said the ad was "in bad taste". While Jade Johnson Adams said: "I can't believe this is a government ad. Is this what the government thinks of colored people?" In a Twitter poll, the majority of users responded "Love it".    Check out the #BoozeFreeRoads ad on our TL and tell us what you think?  — Cape Argus (@TheCapeArgus) May 11, 2017
