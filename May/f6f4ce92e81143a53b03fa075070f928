Joaquin, 8, a Milnerton Primary Grade 3 pupil, is one step closer to winning the South African karting championships. He won the second round of the national competition on Saturday and should he claim the overall title, he will be able to participate in the world finals. Joaquin’s mother, Lucille, is over the moon with her son's achievement. “He's excelled so much in doing this and it makes me so happy,” she said. Lucille admits that she was initially sceptical about allowing Joaquin to participate - and then compete - in karting. “I was extremely nervous but he developed a talent for it very quickly. I would say that him 
riding doesn’t make me nervous, it makes me comfortable,” she said. Lucille said Joaquin, who has been training for four years with renowned go-kart rider, Kito Perdigao, has learnt so much through karting. “My son is doing so well. He takes no nonsense and he communicates very well with us. Whenhe feels there is something he is unhappy about he is not afraid to tell us,” she said. Joaquin has garnered plenty of support, and not just from his family and friends, as he has even secured a sponsorship deal. He will be back on the track on July 22 - which is also his birthday - at Killarney. *  In an earlier article, the Cape Argus stated that Reza  Levy won  the Cape Town Karting National.
