Cape Town – The Western Cape government has announced that the pass rate in the province had increased from 86% to 87.3% after the completion of supplementary exams. In a statement, Education MEC Debbie Shäfer said: "I am delighted to announce the results of the supplementary examinations for the 2016 National Senior Certificate (NSC) in the Western Cape. "Candidates who qualified to write the supplementary examinations did so in February and March this year. "A total of 765 candidates passed the supplementary examinations, while an additional 73 candidates also passed their matric after successfully applying for re-marks. "This means that an additional 838 candidates have now achieved their National Senior Certificate for 2016. "Therefore, the Western Cape now has a total of 44 563 learners that passed the 2016 NSC, increasing our overall pass rate from 86% to 87.3% "While we are proud that we were able to increase our pass rate, this is not our primary indicator of success. Our main objective is to increase the actual number of learners passing matric, and the quality of these passes. We are therefore pleased to see a further increase in the number passing, and further improvement in the quality of these passes. "The percentage of candidates who have qualified for access to Bachelor degree studies has also now increased, from 40.9% to 41.1%. Eighty-nine learners who wrote supplementary exams passed with access to Bachelor degree studies, while 94 passed with access to Bachelor degree studies after applying for a re-mark," she said. Candidates who have yet to receive their results via the post can call the WCED certification/examinations division to obtain their results by phoning 021 467 2000.
