The company debited me this month, saying I signed up for “paralegal advice”. Why would I need paralegal advice? I contacted its offices and was told I agreed to the Ts&Cs to subscribe to its paralegal advice. Yesterday, it debited R429 from my account. These people are trying to scam me and many others. If you are looking for a loan it means you are desperate and have financial problems. Why would you be looking for legal advice when you need finance? I have now been told I owe the company R1053 to cancel the “contact” - a contract I never signed up for. A lot of people are being harassed by these people and have been caught in the same scam. Please check the complaints on Hellopeter.

They are targeting already desperate people - it’s wrong on every level.
