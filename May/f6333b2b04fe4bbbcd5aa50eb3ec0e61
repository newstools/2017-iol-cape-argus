Where and when Justin Bieber performed two shows in South Africa in 2013 as part of his Believe world tour â€“ on May 8, Capetonian Beliebers had a superb time at the Cape Town Stadium and on May 12, Joburg enjoyed themselves thoroughly at the FNB Stadium. This year, as part of his Purpose World tour, Joburg was the first stop, with the Biebs rocking the FNB Stadium on Sunday, May 14. On Wednesday, Cape Town Stadium plays host again. Prices Four years ago, tickets to watch Bieber live in Joburg ranged from R350 to R750. The Cape Town prices ranged from R350 to R700. However, in 2017, Joburg Beliebers were willing to pay between R410 and R1 540. Capetonians paid slightly less with prices ranging from R350 to R1 260. In the days leading up to the concert, some people are shilling their standing room only tickets at R800 a pop. Songs In 2013, Joburg and Cape Town enjoyed hits such as "All around the world", "Die in your arms", "Beauty and the Beat", "Boyfriend" and "Baby" along with many more. But when Bieber's Purpose dropped in 2015, it endeared the superstar to a whole new group of fans with songs like "What do you mean?", "Boyfriend", "Cold Water" and "Sorry" which will have the 2017 audience rocking. Audience In 2013, a few years after his debut, he attracted a fairly young fan base. He was the teenage crush of many preteens and teens. But, by 2017, his audience has evolved. His image changed, people became more interested in his love life and more importantly, his sound changed. This attracted a more mature audience... and was not only limited to a female fanbase. Reports say that more and more grown men are becoming Beliebers. Attendance Prior to the Believe Tour, Computicket sold more than 50 000 tickets for the concert in less than an hour for both the Cape Town and Joburg shows... much to the dismay of fans whose dream it was to see the Biebs live in 2013. According to reports, more than 60 000 Joburg Beliebers braved the chill this year and would jump into cold water (see what I did there?) to see the pop star again. Justin Bieber performs at Cape Town Stadium on Wednesday night.
