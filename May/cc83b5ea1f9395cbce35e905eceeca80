Legal Aid advocate Henk Carstens is to defend murder accused Howard Oliver. On Wednesday, Judge Kate Savage ordered a postponement until June 6. Judge Savage also warned Oliver he would not be able to change lawyers again. “You are only allowed one occasion to terminate legal representative, which you have now used. You have no more chances now,” she said. Earlier this week, Oliver’s previous lawyer Ken Klopper withdrew from the case. He said he had received contradictory statements which would not allow him to continue with the case. “It is ethics,” he told the court. Franziska, 16, went missing in the Tokai forest while jogging with her mother on March 7, 2016. Her naked body was 
found during a search in fynbos. She had been been raped before being murdered. Oliver is facing two charges of rape, and one of  robbery and murder. He pleaded not guilty to the rape and murder charges, but admits to have attacked and robbed 
the teenager of her cellphone. He admits to stripping the 16-year-old of her pants, but said he did not take off her underwear. Oliver said he left Franziska unconscious, but is certain she was breathing.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
