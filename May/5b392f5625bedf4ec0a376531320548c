On Wednesday, in a meeting that was held in Nyanga, community leaders raised a number of issues such as an additional police station to deal with ongoing crime in the area, powers to arrest suspects, deploy more officers. Mbalula said he came to Nyanga as the latest crime statistics released last year showed that the area has one of the highest murder rates in the country and the Western Cape, including attempted murders, sexual offences, robbery and common assault. He said the building of the Muizenberg station police has been stopped and they are prioritising the Samora Machel police station which is needed. “We know it is business unusual. We know there are challenges. We don’t have resources, but we must work with what we have,” Mbalula said.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
