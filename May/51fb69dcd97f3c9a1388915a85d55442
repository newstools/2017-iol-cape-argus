On Wednesday, doctors at Tygerberg Hospital were fighting to save the life of Warrant Officer Denvir Dirks, 44, who has now been hailed a hero for a second time. Dirks, who is stationed at Ravensmead Police Station, was working as a security guard for a bread company in his private capacity when he was attacked by an armed robber in Magalies Street, N2 Gateway, on Wednesday. He is also a former Corporal of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) Cops say Dirks, who is married, was escorting a bread delivery truck just after 10:15am when an unknown gunman shot him in the head and stole his private firearm. Dirks, who is also a pastor and lives in Ravensmead, was rushed to hospital with the bullet lodged behind his ear, and doctors at the trauma room fought to keep him alive. Late Wednesday night, Dirks was said to be in a critical condition and on life support. Police spokesperson Captain FC Van Wyk says the robber fled the scene and is yet to be arrested. “A reservist police officer was shot at and robbed of his private firearm by an unidentified suspect in Delft while protecting a LDV delivering bread in the area,” he said. “He is reservist attached to Ravensmead SAPS, however, he was at his own capacity as he was off duty at the time of the incident." “An attempted murder case was registered for investigation." “Circumstances surrounding this incident are under investigation.” The suspect is believed to have been part of a group of three who fled in a silver VW Jetta. Reggie Maart, the Public Relations Officer for the Police Board and the Blue Downs Cluster Chairperson, commended Dirks for his bravery and called him a hero. On June 6 last year, the officer was aboard a Jason Distributor’s bread truck when three armed robbers in a white Toyota Corolla struck. One of the robbers pulled a firearm and pointed the gun at Dirks, but it jammed. Dirks then opened fire on the robber, killing him instantly. The two other robbers fled the scene. Daily Voice
