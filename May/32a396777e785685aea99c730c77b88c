Cape Town – Thousands of crazed Beliebers queued from early Wednesday afternoon outside the Cape Town Stadium to secure their spot at Canadian pop-star Justin Bieber’s Purpose Tour concert. The hyped fans set up camp outside the stadium, donning their fan gear and bellowing their favourite Bieber tunes in line. Bieber is currently completing his world Purpose Tour and will perform the main act after local supporting act, Sketchy Bongo. Online audiences gave their renditions of carpool karaoke in anticipation of their beloved musician. Roads leading to the stadium were jam-packed and frustrated motorists sat in traffic before 3pm in an attempt to dodge the concert craze.       Security was tight at the venue, with at least one fan taking to social media to vent her frustration.    But, on the whole, most fans didn't mind waiting in line for the concert to start.          Some, tired of waiting, sat on the ground in the stadium precinct.       As #BieberFever gripped Cape Town, fans couldn't wait to share their renditions of their favourite Bieber hits.
