Cape Town – #BieberFever has hit South Africa. Joburg fans have already exhausted their lungs after singing their favourites along with their idol and on Wednesday, it will be Cape Town's turn. True Beliebers might already know more than enough about the singer but below are a few things you might not know about him. 1. His first tattoo is of a bird after a children's book he read with his family. In this book, there was a "seagull who wanted to be more than just a seagull". 2. He has a strong belief in Christianity and has an unwavering relationship with God. "I feel like that’s why I have a relationship with Him, because I need it. I suck by myself. Like, when I’m by myself and I feel like I have nothing to lean on? Terrible. Terrible person," he said in an interview. 3. Bieber's talent piqued the interest of the Guinness Book of World Records. He was recently presented with a plaque for becoming the youngest male artist to debut at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 charts. He is now the owner of eight new record titles. 4. In 2011, he sold some of his hair on eBay. The lock of hair was sold for $40 668 (about R530 000). The proceeds went to an animal rescue organisation. 5. If fame was not part of his everyday life, Bieber would get over to Disneyland. "I’d probably go to Disneyland or somewhere like that and experience it like everyone else gets to."
