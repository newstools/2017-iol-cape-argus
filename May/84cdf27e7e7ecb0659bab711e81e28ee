“When I see food I think visual and taste first, that is my end goal with every recipe.” The idea for this new season came about after fans asked Siba if they could join her at her table. “On social media people have been asking if they can come to my table, but it’s impractical for us to get people to come, especially since the show airs in over 100 countries,” she says. “We thought about inviting people to join the table by submitting their recipes and I will give it a twist. The way we chose the recipes was either something that people wanted to and a twist to or if there was more than one request for a recipe I went with that.” Themes for the new season will include: classics made over, fast, portable, dinner solutions and budget meals.
