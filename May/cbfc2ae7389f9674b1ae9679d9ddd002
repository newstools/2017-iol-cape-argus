Cape Town - Work at the multibillion rand mega development at the old Conradie Hospital site in Pinelands, which would include hundreds of affordable housing units, is expected to finally get under way in 2018, the provincial government has confirmed. The property was one of three where "good progress" was being made, according to Premier Helen Zille's spokesperson, Michael Mpofu, who added the properties were all regarded as top priority. The other two sites were the Helen Bowden Nurses Home in Green Point as well as the old Woodstock Hospital which would be developed at a later stage. Upon its projected completion in 2024, the 22ha Conradie development would house at least 11 000 residents, nearly half of whom would fall in the affordable housing bracket. The affordable housing market is defined as households earning between R3 500 and R25 000 per month.  "We are aiming to break ground in 2018," provincial Housing MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela said in a joint statement.  "This project is being run on stretch targets and tight timeframes, as per our Game Changer methodology (and) is coordinated by a Delivery Unit in the Premierâ€™s office," he said.
