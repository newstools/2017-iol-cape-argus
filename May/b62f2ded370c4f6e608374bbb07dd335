Opposition parties in the provincial legislature allege this was tantamount to corruption, and now want Madikizela’s conduct to be probed. Madikizela's surprise party which was allegedly held at Cape Town's One&Only hotel, it set to be probed by the provincial government. "Premier Helen Zille has noted a media report on allegations around the funding of Human Settlements Minister Bonginkosi Madikizela’s birthday celebration," said Michael Mpofu, spokesman for Helen Zille. "The Premier is currently following due process to establish the facts of the matter. Should further action be required, this will be done in line with good governance practices."  Others eagerly shared their disapproval, with the ANC in the Western Cape previously saying it wanted Human Settlements Minister Lindiwe Sisulu to investigate Madikizela’s “impropriety”. But Madikizela said Phumla Zantsi, a partner at Lawula Trading and Construction, who contributed about R3 000 for the cake, according to a weekend publication, was a friend from the 1990s. ANC provincial secretary Faiez Jacobs previously said: “If there is conflict of interest, if some company received contracts from a government department for returning of the favour, this does amount to corruption. “We are calling for the minister to investigate this impropriety. “We will also be seeking legal advice so that we can lay a case of corruption and fraud.” IOL and Cape Times
