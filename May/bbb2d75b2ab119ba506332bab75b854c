Cape Town – The cross-examination of Sergeant Adrian Kleynhans continued in the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday morning where defence lawyer Pieter Botha grilled the officer about his movement through the house and how he approached the crime scene. Before Kleynhans, who was the first officer on the scene, took the court through his testimony, Judge Siraj Desai stressed that no pictures of survivor Marli Van Breda or the deceased may be published. The media was able to view the picture evidence, but couldn’t publish it. Kleynhans said he had approached the scene as if it was a break in, but noticed not many items had been stolen. A handbag he came across was already open when he searched it. Botha argued that the bag could've been opened by an intruder, but Kleynhans countered, saying the bag could have been left open by the owner. Botha also questioned Kleynhans about drawers that had been left open. Kleynhans had testified that apart blood on the alleged murder weapon – an axe – and on some of the walls, there was no other blood spatters, but Botha said there was evidence of blood elsewhere. Kleynhans said his primary concern was to provide assitance to Marli, who had sustained a blow to the head, and told the court how he had led paramedics to her side. He said he tried not to disturb the scene. Kleynhans said that one of the paramedics told him to take photos of the scene before they reached Marli. While Kleynhans had said he smelled alcohol on triple murder-accused Henri van Breda's breath, Botha said no alcohol or chemicals were found in his blood according to medical test results. Henri is accused of murdering his parents Martin and Theresa, and his brother Rudi, in their De Zalze, Stellenbosch home in 2015. He also faces a charge of attempted murder.
