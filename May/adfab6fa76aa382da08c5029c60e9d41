Cape Town – It wasn't your usual high school reunion. Instead of getting together to celebrate material, academic or business successes, the Harold Cressy class of 1985/86 got together to honour their teachers who had inspired their "political, cultural and social consciousness", according to former pupil Enver Essop. The reunion was held at the District Six Homecoming Centre. The class of '85 chose to join the protests against the apartheid government, sacrificing their schooling and opting to repeat matric in 1986. "We remember the shared values of many to strive for 'success' in the face of apartheid pressures and to support teachers who were arrested, dismissed or went unpaid," Essop said. Former principal Victor Ritchie, 93, joined the celebrations. He recalled how the Education Department refused to pay the salaries of seven teachers who were considered "too politically active and were inciting pupils to revolt". In solidarity, Ritchie and his teaching staff pooled their salaries to ensure no teacher went home unpaid. Considered by the pupils as "iconic teachers", Essop said they were "teachers we can only dream of retaining at schools today". "What stood out about the reunion was how the teachers were remembered by former pupils, with such pride, including by those who repeated a year or dropped out or who did badly at maths, science and Latin. "What mattered were the former pupils’ memories of the integrity, commitment and knowledge of teachers. This was such an inspiration at a time when teachers and people involved with learning were seen as stupid for working so hard for so little," Essop said.
