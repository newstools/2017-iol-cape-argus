Cape Town –  Mayor Patricia de Lille is prepared to fund Van der Byl, 16, as he travels to Germany in September. The teenager from Blikkiesdorp was chosen to be part of City Mission Educational Service’s seventh international soccer tour. The Cape Argus reported on Wednesday that the family has financial issues and couldn't send Van der Byl overseas. “I am very proud of Jayde, but there are still financial issues involved, like the visa and the (plane) ticket,” his dad and first coach, Errol van der Byl said. But, De Lille has stepped up to the plate. “I read with interest and pride Jayde’s amazing story about his accomplishments in soccer," she said on Thursday. "It is always so heartwarming when I read about people, especially young people, rising above adversity to achieve great things.” She would also be writing a letter to Jayde to inform him about the sponsorship. “As the City of Cape Town we know that sport plays an important role in a young person’s development as it is also an effective way of building your skills and not falling prey to the social evils.” Jayde's dad was delighted to hear that his son would now be able to travel to Germany since the mayor would be putting up the R30 000 he needs to join the tour. Since the article was published, he said there had been an immense outpouring of support. “I’m just happy that there are people that are willing to assist – it's so incredible,” he said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za
