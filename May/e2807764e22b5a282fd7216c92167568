Cape Town – Dam levels are dangerously low at 19.7% with only 9.7% of the water being usable. Yesterday the dams levels feeding the city were: Berg River Dam – 31.0% Steenbras Lower – 23.5% Steenbras Upper – 56.7% Theewaterskloof – 13.7% Voelvlei – 14.5% Wemmershoek – 36.1% Informal Settlements, Water and Waste Services and Energy Mayco member Xanthea Limberg said it was disappointing that collective consumption remained at 666 million litres, way above the target of 600 million litres. "The City has also noted recent hoaxes about water quality in Cape Town," Limberg said on Monday. "While the last 10% of a dam’s volume is difficult to treat to acceptable standards, we have not yet reached this level. Water remains safe to drink. Water undergoes extensive filtration as well as chemical treatment before it is pressure-fed into the reticulation system. Water quality is controlled at the treatment plants by process controllers who perform tests on an hourly basis in the on-site labs in order to make the necessary adjustments. "We are currently in the most critical stage of this drought crisis, yet consumption remains too high. Residents are reminded to use water only for drinking, washing and cooking. Tougher restrictions will be implemented this week." Limberg urged residents to cut their water usage to under 100 litres per person per day and suggested taking two-minute showers and only flushing the toilet when necessary. "A five-minute shower can use between 40 litres and 70 litres, and flushing a toilet uses 6 to 21 litres, depending on the size of the cistern. One shower and five flushes of an average-sized toilet will push a person over their daily allowance, and this is not even taking into account other necessities such as drinking, cooking, and washing of clothes and dishes."  brownyn.davids@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
