These were the words Arts and Culture Minister Nathi Mthethwa used ahead of Africa Day which is being celebrated today. He was addressing delegates at an Africa Month colloquium in the city this week when he urged people to categorise the continent based on their own experiences, not the perception of others. “Even as we have been subjected to the ravages of colonialism, segregation and apartheid and as we acknowledge that we reside in an era of rapid globalisation, even as others seek to dehumanise us and leave us with their culture of violence, which we fight every day, every point of the way, we still need to stand our ground,” Mthethwa said.
