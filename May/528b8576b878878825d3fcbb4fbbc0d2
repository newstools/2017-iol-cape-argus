Insaaf  Gaidien has worked at the centre for a year. It is located in Kuils River and  serves as a halfway house for babies who are abandoned, orphaned and the result of  unplanned pregnancies. They care for the  babies until they are adopted. Gaidien said that she wanted to break away from the traditional 21st birthday party celebrations and decided to use the day as a day to give back to the needy instead. She is calling on the public to bring along much-needed donations for either the staff or infants. Members of the public can either donate money or get something of the Rock A Bye Baby House “Wish List” which consists of either medication or baby toiletries. “My family first asked me what I want to do for my birthday. Then I said that it would be too expensive and my parents can’t afford it. So I told my parents that instead we should give it to people who need it. “This  way people will get to know more about Rock A Bye.” Gaidien also said that the reason why she chose to do something for Rock A Bye was because she considers the safe haven a second home for her. “This is like a second home for me and these babies are like my own,” she said. Currently the home is in need of a new roof but it’s too expensive. Gaidien also admits that she got a lot of raised eyebrows by her friends when she discussed her 21st  birthday plans. “My friends first asked why and I said because I want to to this,” Gaidien said. Her boss Yolande Barnard, who is the safety parent of the home, said she couldn’t be more proud. “When I heard first what Insaaf was planning I was sceptical but it’s for a good cause. She is a good  person,” Barnard said. Those who would like to attend or donate are encouraged to first RSVP before coming to the Rock A Bye.
