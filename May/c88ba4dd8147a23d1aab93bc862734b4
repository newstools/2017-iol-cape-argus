Juanita Pieters told the staff at the mortuary that she wants to know how her youngest child died. Roegshanda Pascoe, a spokesperson for the family, said: “Juanita is very disturbed and has cried uncontrollably." "She asked them about the cotton wool and the neck brace, which she saw around Courtney's neck. And she wanted to know if her daughter was strangled. But they could not give her answers.” Other questions are how long after Courtney's disappearance she was killed and whether she was still alive inside the room of her alleged killer after she disappeared. Courtney's body was found nine days after she went missing on May 13. Her body was discovered in a plastic bag on a field in Epping Industry near Bofors Circle. Her body was found in a shallow grave. Nineteen children have been killed in the Western Cape since the beginning of the year. Joanne Barrett, spokesperson for Women and Men Against Child Abuse, said: “Too many children are dying terrible violent deaths. How many more children have to die? We believe that heinous crimes such as this must carry a life sentence.” Cape Argus
