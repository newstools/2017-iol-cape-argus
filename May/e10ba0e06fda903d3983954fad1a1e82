Advocate Pieter Botha introduced CCTV footage highlighting certain instances of vehicles entering the premises without being properly logged. On the night of the Van Breda murders, there were at least two instances of vehicles entering the estate that hadn't been logged in the security notes.  A minibus taxi was seen entering the estate at 4.16 am. The registration number appears to have been written down by a security guard, but there was no record of it. Security manager Marcia Rossouw, who was being cross-examined, said while the instance should have been logged, that particular case could have been someone with an access tag. They would not be required to sign the visitors' log. At 4.29 am, another car was seen entering the gate without being flagged down. It was allowed to continue into the estate without a sign-in. Botha said there was no record of that vehicle either. Rossouw was excused and a new witness was due to give evidence in the afternoon session on Tuesday.  theolin.tembo@inl.co.za  @thelionmutters Cape Argus
