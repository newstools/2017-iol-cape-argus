Cape Town – The mother of Shasha-Lee November, who went missing two years ago at age 6, remains hopeful her daughter will return home. Sandra November said she sat outside her home, imagining Shasha-Lee would return. “I’ve been having sleepless nights since my child went missing. Everything isn’t the same anymore,” November said on Tuesday. Shasha-Lee disappeared while playing outside her home in Hanover Park. November said two days after the incident she had suffered a stroke, leaving her unable to work and adding to her stress. Shasha-Lee’s father, Calvin, appealed to anyone with information about the whereabouts of his daughter to come forward. “All our lives have changed drastically in this time but I know God will provide,” he said. Residents of Hanover Park are set to gather on Wednesday night to hold a vigil in honour of Shasha-Lee. “I appreciate the overwhelming support the community has given me,” November said. Mayor Patricia de Lille had also put out a reward of R25 000 for positive leads, but police said no arrests had been made.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za
