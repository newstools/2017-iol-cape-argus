Twenty three groups participated  around the Peninsula on Monday. The Cape Argus attended host school Rhodes High School to watch the round robin phase (the third round), which is a preliminary phase. The participating schools were Rhodes High, Sea Point High, Vista High and Gardens Commercial High. Pupils from various schools had to study the Cape Argus before battling it out in the competition. They were asked a variety of questions, ranging from general knowledge to politics, entertainment and sport. Pupils also had the support of their principals and teachers, who were present at the event. “I absolutely love this initiative, it’s fantastic,” said Charline Little, the principal of Vista High School. Little said the initiative helped her get to know her pupils. “Some of my pupils wants to study criminology, I didn’t know this.” Little was also extremely proud of the amount of dedication her pupils had shown throughout the duration of the competition. The particular nail-biting round robin round was won by Vista High School with 37 points, followed by Gardens, Rhodes and Sea Point. The knock-out round will be held in the third term.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
