Workers’ Day has been used by the working class across the world, South Africa included, to emphasise the need to establish fair labour practices and employment standards. Many local political organisations had marches and rallies in honour of the day and the people it celebrates. The EFF released a statement saying that it sees the day as a socialist and communist holiday that must be associated with the vision of workers' freedom as expressed in the Communist Manifesto. “This vision is that ultimately true freedom from capitalist exploitation is where the means of production are socialised to benefit society as a whole, and not just a few families. “As we mark Workers Day, we call on workers to unite and reject all ideologies and tendencies that seek to fracture them. Only through workers' unity will real wages be won across all sectors. We call on Trade Union movements to prioritise workers' interests and not the interests and careers of politicians. Workers' power must at all times be marshalled against the capitalists and all the conditions that perpetuate workers' exploitation.” Cosatu conducted a march in the Cape Town CBD where they intended to hand over a memorandum to the Cape Chamber of Commerce and Industry to demand the removal of the corrupt CEOs. The march was then expected to head to the Western Cape Provincial Legislature to demand the removal of Premier Helen Zille "for her racism and corruption". The march was due to end at the national government building in Plein Street to demand the removal of President Jacob Zuma, also for his alleged complicity in corruption.             Democratic Alliance (DA) leader, Mmusi Maimane, celebrated Workers’ Day with a rally at the Blue Downs Stadium in Cape Town. "This year South Africa celebrates the 23rd anniversary of Workers’ Day, a day when we honour the long-fought struggle to establish a culture of human and workers’ rights and to secure fair employment standards, now protected and enshrined in section 23 of our Constitution," the DA said. "It is also a day in which we celebrate and honour the millions of working South Africans who help build this country every day, forming the backbone of our economy. Workers who provide services, teach our children, build infrastructure, make products and look after us in hospitals. Without them, our country would simply not move forward."
