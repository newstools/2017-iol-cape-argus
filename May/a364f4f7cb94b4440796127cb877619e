Rimmer, who spends her days reading crime novels, credits her longevity to taking things easy, not smoking, having the odd tipple, and  long walks. “I feel wonderful. I take things slowly. I’ve walked all my life and I never sit still.” Rimmer said the way she was brought up had played a vital role. “When I was young I was told never to speak out of turn and to always allow other people to talk first.” Rimmer also loves scrapbooking. She started collecting clippings for them towards the end of World War II. Rimmer said her diet hadn’t changed much. “I eat too much. My favorite foods are curry, bean curry, cabbage stew and soups,” she said. Rimmer has no big birthday plans for the day. However, she had a big surprise when the seniors club she belongs to threw her a party last month “My father was from Ireland so everything at the party was Irish. It was so beautiful,” she said. Rimmer said she had two children. Her son died 27 years ago, but her daughter is still alive. She also has six grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and two great-great grandchildren.
