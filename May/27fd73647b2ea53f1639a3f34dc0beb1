Cape Town – HRH The Duke of Edinburgh has decided that he will no longer carry out public engagements from the autumn of this year, according to a Royal statement released by Buckingham Palace on Thursday. The Duke has the full support of The Queen, the statement read.The statement continued: "Prince Philip will attend previously scheduled engagements between now and August, both individually and accompanying The Queen. Thereafter, The Duke will not be accepting new invitations for visits and engagements. The Queen will continue to carry out a full programme of official engagements with the support of members of the Royal Family." Earlier a Buckingham Palace official told The Associated Press that a meeting of royal household staff had been called, but that there is "no cause for concern." The official spoke on Thursday after a report of an unusual meeting of royal household staff sparked speculation about the health of Queen Elizabeth II, 91, and her husband Prince Philip, 95. Both appeared to be in good health Wednesday. The queen met with Prime Minister Theresa May at the palace and Philip made an appearance at a London cricket club. The official, who spoke to the AP only on condition of anonymity, said household meetings are called from time to time. * Adapted from the official Royal Statement, AP and IOL
