Cape Town â€“ From the streets of Khayelitsha to the casting halls of Hollywood, little Kwakho Mamputa, seven, is living the dream. The cute, shy performer from Eluxolweni Primary School aced her iPOP auditions in Cape Town to get the opportunity to show off her skills in front of some of the top agents, managers, casting directors and industry professionals in showbiz. iPOP is an international competition showcasing the talents of some of the best up and coming actors, models, singers and dancers. And her mom, Brenda Mamputa, couldn't be more proud. Kwakho's aunt, Hombakazi Mamputa, said her mom supports her 100%. "Since Kwakho was born, she was a model. If you could see her perform, you can sense that she is gifted. Her mother, Brenda, always supports her. You will see Kwakho on stage wearing something colourful and doing her thing. We are proud of her." Kwakho's teacher, Nomveliso Dyum, said: "Kwakho is a very shy girl, she is always in class doing her work or in her own world happy and doing something creative." Her deputy principal, LN Fikeni, said: "This is a very important opportunity for the young learner (Kwakho), and also for other learners of the school. This is good news for the community as well, because it will empower other children to partake in similar opportunities." Kwakho is part of the Khayelitsha Modelling School in Khayelitsha, and her amazing talent will see her represent SA abroad. As part of the performance in Hollywood, those who are selected by the judging panel will showcase their talent at the iPOP Celebration of Success Awards Night where top international agents will be searching for the next big star. The only thing standing in Kwakho getting to Hollywood is the cost. Those who wish to assist can contact Kwakho's mom, Brenda, on 073 148 7626 or at mamputa.brenda@gmail.com.
