The incident happened in the scenic town of Villiersdorp after the four allegedly stole apples and were apprehended by the officers. After the four were made to stand against a cliff at the roadside, the video shows the officers removing the apples from their vehicle and pelting them. The mayor of Theewaterskloof, Christelle Vosloo, has condemned the incident. “It was inhuman and a gross violation of the safety and dignity of the victims.” The mayor said she cannot comment on where the apples were allegedly stolen. Vosloo said the matter would be dealt  with swiftly and she would meet with the victims as soon as they were able to identify all of them. “I noted the video footage showing people dressed in the uniforms of law enforcers throwing apples at the victims and was appalled by the incident. "I'm devastated that the victims had to endure this trauma and I believe their constitutional rights not to be exposed to psychological, emotional and physical abuse were violated. “I regard the conduct of the attackers as inhumane and a gross violation of the safety and dignity of their victims. The officers can be heard taunting the men and using abusive language.”   She added that an investigation was to be launched into the conduct of the law enforcement officers. "If any personnel of the municipality are found guilty they will face the strongest disciplinary action possible. “I call on the community to give me and the municipality an opportunity to investigate the incident and to deal with it appropriately. I will keep them informed on an on-going basis.”  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
