Cape Town – “I am so tired,” sniffed Juanita Peters, distraught mother of missing three-year-old girl Courtney Peters. Courtney vanished from the corner of Grand Vue and Milky Way, Salberau, Elsies River about 100 metres from her home in 23 Pluto Street on Thursday around 8am. Peters said that these past few days were terrible and that she didn’t want to speak to anyone, especially the media. “I can’t do anything, I can’t wash and then there is somebody coming here. I can’t cook and then somebody else comes. I don’t get a chance, all these people bothering me. I can’t cook, when are my children going to eat?" Courtney's mom, Juanita Peters, is comforted by family members.
