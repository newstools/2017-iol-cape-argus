Cape Town – Two men are being detained at the Mowbray police station in Cape Town after they were found in possession of loaded, illegal firearms. Cape Town Traffic Principal Inspector Maxine Bezuidenhout said two officers with the city's Ghost Unit were performing a routine traffic stop on the N2 inbound on Thursday morning.  "The driver of the Hyundai sedan received a ticket for driving an unlicensed vehicle. While the officers were issuing the ticket, one of three passengers in the vehicle alighted and walked towards a second vehicle some way off that had broken down. "He called out to a second passenger who also got out of the Huyndai.  "It was during this time that one of the traffic officers noticed one of the men hiding something along the fence of the nearby golf course. "The officer called for backup and when they searched the area, they found two firearms – a 9mm pistol that was reported stolen in 2016 and a .38 special revolver sans serial number.  "Both weapons were loaded and ready to fire. "The two men were arrested and detained at Mowbray SAPS on charges of possession of illegal firearms and ammunition," she said.
