Last year, Sotyu visited Harare Police Station following media reports on how poorly Sinoxolo’s case was being handled compared to that of 16-year-old Franziska Blöchliger, whose body was  found naked in Tokai forest. A  swift arrest had been made in the Franziska murder. Cross-examining Constable Nomaphondomise Gobodo, defence lawyer Shaid Bruinders said: “The criticism is of police dragging their feet on this matter. It goes towards whether police were pressured to find the suspects.” Gobodo responded: “I do not recall police being pressured.” A  second witness, the victim’s sister-in-law Iminathi Mafevuka, was called. She is married to Sinoxolo’s brother, Lonwabo. The three had been living together. Sinoxolo’s body was found, half naked, in communal toilets at
the SST Block in Town Two, Khayelitsha. Iminathi said Sinoxolo had left their home at 7pm after preparing supper, saying she was going to the toilet. She didn’t return that night, but it was not unusual for her not to go back home as she often slept at her boyfriend Viwe Mafilika’s home. Viwe is a cousin of the accused, Athabile Mafilika and Xolisa Mafilika. “I was going to the toilets and saw people standing. I went to stand with the crowd too, and then I saw police taking out clothes that looked like those Sinoxolo was wearing when she left. “I told my neighbour the clothes looked like Sinoxolo’s and that it could be her. I was in tears,” she said. Iminathi said she went back to check if Sinoxolo was at her boyfriend’s home, but the shack was padlocked. “It was only when police came to my house and asked for her (Sinoxolo’s) ID book that they had told me it was indeed her body lying in that toilet cubicle,” she said. The trial continues on Wednesday.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
