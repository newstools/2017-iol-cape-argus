Here are the top ten ways to celebrate #StarWarsDay, according to The Walt Disney Company. 1. What’s your favorite Rey or Jyn move? Be sure to Tweet your photos to @starwars and let us know how your celebrating, hashtag #StarWarsDay 2. You know that First Order symbol tattoo you’ve been thinking about getting? Today’s the day. 3. Dressing up for special occasions is important, and May the 4th is no different. Wearing anything from your favorite Star Wars shirt to full-on Stormtrooper gear is completely acceptable. (It’s okay to dress up your pet, too. Bounty hunter bulldogs are especially encouraged.) 4. Have a Star Wars movie marathon with friends and family! But which movie do you begin with? Do you start with the prequels, the original trilogy or The Force Awakens? When do you watch Rogue One? Do you mix in some episodes of The Clone Wars and Star Wars Rebels? Better decide before your guests arrive, or you may spend the day in a heated debate. 5. Food is an essential part of any holiday. Treat your school or work friends to a fresh batch of Wookiee Cookies or Death Star Cake Pops. Find a variety of recipes on StarWars.com! 6. Are you a gamer? Hop online with your friends via Star Wars Battlefront or invite them over for some classic board game action! 7. Feel the Force with Star Wars crafts: turn clay into an awesome Star Wars keepsake! Learn how to make Clay Yoda, Star Wars Bookmark, and more at StarWars.com! 8. Sometimes people use holidays to travel to new places. Why not go to Disneyland or Disney World and ride Star Tours? There are over 50 separate mission possibilities...how many rides can you fit into a day at the park? 9. As Yoda said: “Pass on what you have learned.” Introduce a younger sibling, family member, or friend to Star Wars! 10. Do you have any Star Wars toys that you don’t need any more? Donate them and make May the 4th really memorable for children in need.
