Cape Town – “When we moved the body, blood ran like a waterfall down onto the lower step from at top of stairs,” said Christiaan Koegelenberg, one of the first paramedics on the scene on the scene on the night of the Van Breda family murders. Koegelenberg gave evidence in the Western Cape High Court on Tuesday in the trial of Henri van Breda, one of two surviving family members of the De Zalze axe murders. In Koegelenberg's 39 years of experience as a paramedic, the Van Breda murder scene was the most gruesome he had ever seen. Koegelenberg recalled that he and his colleague were called to the scene, the accused, Henri van Breda, was sitting with a dog. When Koegelenberg entered they were led through the scene by Sergeant Adrian Kleynhans, the first police officer on the scene. Koegelenberg said he immediately noticed the bodies of daughter Marli and mother Teresa van Breda at the top of the stairs. It was his colleague who would alert him to the fact that Marli was still alive, and he then told Kleynhans to take a picture of the scene before they moved her. “Mother and daughter were lying alongside each other, while father and son were laying in another room. With the movement of the body, the blood then started dripping like a waterfall.” The paramedics quickly put Marli in the ambulance to transport her to Stellenbosch Mediclinic. The matter resumes on Wednesday.  theolin.tembo@inl.co.za  @thelionmutters
