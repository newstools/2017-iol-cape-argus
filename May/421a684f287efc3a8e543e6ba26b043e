The comes after seven days of searching in rubbish bins and risking their lives by walking in known red-zone areas. Chairperson for the Manenberg Safety Forum Roegshanda Pascoe said Juanita Peters joined the search, as she came back from counselling stronger. Peters said she appreciates everyone who joined the vigil and the support she has been receiving. Pascoe said they are waiting for search warrants because there were people who refused them permission. “We cannot patrol the streets in Elsies River at night properly because they don't have street lights. We are also asking the police to be more vigilant and open resources because by now they should have observed the CCTV footages in the area, maybe that might lead them somewhere.” She said they are urging people not to spread false rumours the child has been found. Courtney disappeared from her Elsies River home last Thursday. She was last seen at about 8am 100m from her Pluto Street home. The petite little girl was wearing a white and yellow T-shirt with blue shorts and was bare feet. Anyone with information is requested to contact warrant officer Lawrence on 079 894 0107 or Elsies River SAPS on 021 933 0308.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
