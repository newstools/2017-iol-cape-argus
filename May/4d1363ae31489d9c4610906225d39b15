Cape Town – A host of schools will be battling it out on Monday in the greatly anticipated annual Cape Argus Food Lover’s High Schools Quiz from 4pm to 5pm. This will be the first of the round robin stages, where the pupils will have to answer 40 questions, with teams scoring five points for every correct answer but losing three points for anything they get wrong. This year pupils from 92 schools will show off their general knowledge, answering questions on general news, entertainment, politics and sport within the pages of the Cape Argus. The 92 schools were split into 23 groups of four schools each. The quiz was started with the hope of empowering high school pupils, and the teams will be competing for a cash prize of R200 000 and other prizes. Cape Argus editor Aziz Hartley said: "We are very pleased to be presenting these young future leaders with the opportunity to test their skills and compete with their peers. We wish them all good luck and look forward to a very exciting contest, and also thank the school staff and teachers for the support they are showing to the pupils.” Fixtures for Monday's first round robin stage.

Mangaru said they were proud to be the headline sponsor of the schools quiz for the fourth consecutive year. “This campaign is very close to our hearts and roots. We believe that it is vitally important to invest in the future retailers, accountants, operations or human resource managers and business executives of tomorrow. "The addition of 10 new schools participating in the 2017 campaign is testament to the growth of the Cape Argus Food Lover’s Market High Schools Quiz and supports our belief that education is vitally important to the social and economic well-being of South Africa.”
