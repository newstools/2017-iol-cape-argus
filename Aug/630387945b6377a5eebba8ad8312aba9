The sickly bird was found wandering on a beach in Blombos earlier this week by Cleo Rowe, who took care of it for two days before handing it over to Sanccob (Southern African Foundation for the Conservation of Coastal Birds). The bird was brought to Rowe by a friend who found it while fishing. “The penguin was alone and could barely stand, so I took it in and bathed it and fed it until we were able to take it to Sanccob. “I showered with it and it followed me around. It was a once in a lifetime experience and I am blessed.” Rowe said her pet dog and cat had welcomed the new addition and showed love to it and helped her care for it. “After feeding it and taking care of it, I could see a difference in its condition and two of my friends took it to Sanccob.” Sanccob bird rehabilitator Marna Smit said that while the organisation did not advise keeping a wild animal, the penguin was in a better state when it arrived there than when Rowe had taken it in. “When you find a bird you must bring it in immediately. If it doesn’t run away from you or try to get back into the ocean, that means there is a problem and the bird needs help. "In this case the bird was dehydrated, weak and could barely walk.” Smit said it would have been better if they had been called in order for them to assist with how to take care of the bird. “The bird was taken to the vet and was stabilised, and is currently in recovery.” Cape Argus
