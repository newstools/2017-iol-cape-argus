Cape Town - The M5 out of Cape Town could be a little more snarled up than usual due to a crash at the Racecourse Road intersection. Six people were injured on Wednesday afternoon when a taxi crashed into a car, ER24 said. "Six people were injured following a collision between a taxi and light motor vehicle at the Racecourse and M5 intersection in the Kenilworth area of the Western Cape," spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "ER24 paramedics, along with Life Healthcare and other services, arrived on the scene and found both vehicles on the side of the road. The occupants from the taxi had already climbed out of the vehicle and were walking around on the scene. "Paramedics assessed the patients and found that a total of six had sustained injuries ranging from minor to moderate. Fortunately, no serious or fatal injuries were reported on the scene. "The patients were treated for their injuries and were thereafter transported to nearby hospitals for further treatment. Local authorities were on the scene to conduct an investigation into this incident," he said.
