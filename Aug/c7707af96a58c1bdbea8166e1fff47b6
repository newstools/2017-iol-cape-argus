Cape Town - Ten families in Pella Town, Atlantis are overjoyed after being handed the keys to their very own homes. It's just the first step in the housing handover that will benefit the elderly, residents with disabilities and the indigent who had been living on vacant land along Klein Dassenberg Road for many years. The R19.6 million project will deliver homes for 180 families once completed in August 2018. Mayor Patricia De Lille handed over the keys on Thursday. The property was previously owned by the Moravian Church before parcels of land were transferred into the names of the beneficiaries by the national department of land reform and rural development more than 10 years ago. The first batch of residents moved into their homes over the weekend. The completed structures are two bedroom homes with an open plan kitchen, dining area and a bathroom with a basin and bath. Contractors are currently in the process of completing 10 homes for residents with disabilities. These homes will have a wheelchair ramp, wider doors and modified bathrooms. "We are delighted to be able to restore dignity to our residents," De Lille said. "It gives me great pleasure to hand over the keys to the new homes to the beneficiaries because it has been a journey of decades for many of them." De Lille hoped the new homeowners would set an example to other residents who would soon receive their own homes. "Some of the key priorities pursued by the Transport and Urban Development Authority are to promote security of tenure for residents in less formal areas and to partner with the private sector and other government departments in addressing the housing need in Cape Town," De Lille said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
