JOHANNESBURG - Kjell Jonevret chose to jump rather than be pushed out of Orlando Pirates. The Swedish coach tendered in his resignation on Tuesday, amid speculation that the Buccaneers were planning to replace him with Milutin Sredojevic. "I would like to thank the club for the opportunity," Jonevret said. "Unfortunately it didn’t work out as planned. I wish the club and its supporters all the best for the future.” Jonevret had only been in charge of Pirates for close to five months since taking over an already sinking ship in February. In those months he struggled to steer the club out of the slump, even though he guided them to the final of the Nedbank Cup. SuperSport United humbled them 4-1 in that final, compounding the club's misery of finishing outside the top eight for the first time in their history. "I wish Kjell Jonevret well in his future endeavours," Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza said. @NJABULON IOL Sport   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
