The “old gal” from Surrey Estate was dressed in a golden jacket matching her skirt and golden hat.
When asked if she knew it was her birthday, she smiled, indicating she knew. “When we heard that Helena was celebrating her 100th birthday and her community was surprising her with a party, we wanted to be a part of this special milestone. We decided that only a 1mx1.5m cake would be good enough, and when we handed it over we felt her excitement and appreciation,” Shoprite said. Johanna Solomons, 60, who is Helena’s daughter, said her mother’s happiness meant the world to her. “She knew it was her birthday but did not know we were planning something this big. I am very happy to see the excitement and how she is so happy. I am truly blessed to still have my mother at this age,” Solomons said. Helena, who is in a wheelchair, spends her days reading books, magazines and newspapers. She has 34 grandchildren, 31
great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. Cape Argus
