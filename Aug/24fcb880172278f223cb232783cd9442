Cape Town - After seven successful seasons of the popular reality show, Our Perfect Wedding is switching gears with a presenter search open to the public. With three seasons under her belt ushering couples to the altar, Thembisa Mdoda is bidding farewell to the show. “Thembisa Mdoda’s contract has come to an end. We thank her for her commitment and contribution to the success of OPW,” said Nondumiso Mabece, Head of Publicity at M-Net Local Entertainment Channels. “We are looking forward to the exciting journey the show will be taking, opening up the platform for a hidden gem, a new face with untapped talent. This is an opportunity not to be missed,” Mabece said. The reality wedding show, which documents the real-life journeys of ordinary South Africans as they create their perfect wedding day, continues to own Sunday night viewing by creating weddings that keep South Africans talking. The magic and the celebration of love carries on as Nomsa Buthelezi returns as the host while OPW is looking for a new face. “The new presenter will need to have a warm personality to match and the ability to connect with the viewers,” said Mabece. Here’s what you need to know to prepare for the auditions:
