Robertson, 23, will be doing his Master’s degree. He was also a semi-finalist for a SAMRO scholarship for keyboard players that would send him overseas as well. He withdrew from that and is now on his way to Michigan. “Unfortunately I will miss the this year’s final round event to be held on August 26, as I had to sacrifice and withdraw. “Because my dream to study abroad was fortuitously granted. My passion for music started at a young age and was inspired by my teacher. I come from a family that does not have a history with music, but they support me a lot,” he said. Robertson, from Rondebosch, is currently a student at the UCT’s Music School. In 2016, he made it onto the Dean’s Merit List during his undergraduate studies and graduated with distinctions in flute, organ, music theory & analysis and chamber music at the South African College of Music, UCT. Neil recently auditioned for a Master’s in music at three of the five schools to which he applied in the US. He was successful in all these endeavours, being offered a place at three, and wait listed at two. He also received scholarship offers from two prestigious universities. “I will be starting in September in Michigan and I am ridiculously happy. Apart from the generous scholarship I received upon admission, I received support from the Friends of Orchestral Music, the Apollo Music Trust and most recently from the Oppenheimer Memorial Trust. I cannot thank them enough for this immense honour. "I want to continue making my parents proud and want to inspire other children, who want to study music, because with hard work and persistence they can make it.”  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  CAPE ARGUS
