Cape Town -Â DNA samples taken from two cousins accused of the rape and murder of Sinoxolo Mafevuka did not match any DNA found on her body, the Western Cape High Court heard on Monday. Investigating Officer Constable Isaac Tshabalala said samples were swabbed from the mouths of Athabile Mafilika and Xolisa Mafilika, but did not match any DNA on Mafevuka's body. The samples were also tested for compatability against clothing found at the scene of her body's discovery. These turned up negative. "For DNA we focussed on those jerseys, but unfortunately on the body itself the only DNA found was that of the victim herself," Tshabalala said. "No further DNA was found. "No DNA of the victim or any other male person was found the jersey itself." Tshabalala said fingerprints of the two accused were also compared to prints found on the crime scene. "From the toilet door the prints were not fully developed and could not be compared to any other person," he said. No blood was found on the items of clothing found at the scene and no biological material was found under Mafevuka's fingernails. A doctor's report said no bruises were found on the arms of the deceased nor were there any defensive wounds. Mafevuka,19, was found dead in communal toilets at the SST Block in Town Two, Khayelitsha, on March 2, 2016. She was naked, save for an item of clothing tied around her waste. Her clothes were stuffed into the toilet's cistern while others were stuffed into the toilet bowl.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
