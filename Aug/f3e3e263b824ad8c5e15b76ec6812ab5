Cape Town - ANC President Jacob Zuma was described as being in a jovial mood ahead of a motion of no confidence.
With just hours before the debate is scheduled to take place in the National Assembly, ANC spokesman Zizi Kodwa says party leaders are confident the 8th motion against Zuma will fail, like the others before it .    Zizi was speaking to IOL just minutes after the party had concluded it’s caucus to cement the party's position ahead of the vote which will take place in a form of a secret ballot.    “He (Zuma) is jovial like the rest of us, He was in the caucus which was addressed by the Secretary General of the ANC,” He said. “We are all in a jovial mood, this is but one day where the ANC is being  tested and you don’t want to test the ANC and back it into a corner just because you think in the public domain the ANC does not appear united.” IOL
