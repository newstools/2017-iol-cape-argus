Cape Town - When trouble is brewing a photojournalist needs to head towards the trouble and not away from it. "When taking pictures in a potentially dangerous situation, I go into a zone where the desire to capture a great image is a priority," says ANA Pictures photographer Tracey Adams. "This, combined with the discernment to take a good calculated risk compels me to move toward the action to capture the moment." Adams is one of 16 women involved in visual content production at Independent Media's sister company ANA Pictures. She says her favourite assignments involve taking pictures of fashion, protests, animals and people. Adams says she has a recurring dream of being present when a catastrophe occurs. "But in my dream, I forget to take pictures." So her dream assignment "is to be present when a catastrophe happens and to have the presence of mind to take lots of pictures." Another woman photographer working for ANA Pictures, Karen Sandison, has two dream assignments: one in SA and one abroad. "I would like travel across South Africa and shoot pictures from people to trains and rivers to Namaqualand. My out of the country dream assignments are a photo assignment to the Antarctic and the gorillas in Rwanda," Sandison says. She says the hardest pictures to capture is after a death. "A funeral, an interview with someone who has lost a family member or friend. I feel as though I'm invading their space. I have great difficulty lifting my camera to my eye, the shutter sounds so loud in this quiet space." Sandison says the best part of her job is that "every day brings new, different and exciting challenges. I never know what tomorrow holds and each assignment has it's own uniqueness". And her advice for young up-and-coming photojournalists is: "Only look back to learn from your mistakes, strength lies in moving forward."
