The plan outlines how the city can transform its public transportation systems at the same time ensuring the long-term financial and fiscal sustainability of the operations. As with other metros in the country, Cape Town has limited resources to meet immediate service delivery needs. The roll-out Phase 1 of the MyCiTi service and the extension of the service to Mitchells Plain and Khayelitsha through the N2 Express service have played a key role in providing communities from low-income areas with safe, affordable and decent public transport. “The IPTN Business Plan provides the long-term strategic business model and assesses the conditions under which the city can achieve these goals while ensuring fiscal and financial sustainability. "Thus, through careful planning, adapting to a changing environment, pragmatism and innovation, we can extend the MyCiTi footprint while ensuring sufficient revenue to cover the ongoing operating and maintenance costs,” said Mayco member for transport and urban development Brett Herron. He added that the plan was to reduce the cost and congestion and to increase the shift from private to public transport to support operators and improve the convenience and safety of public transport. “We foresee that by formalising and modernising the minibus-taxi industry, the operators will become our partners in transforming the method and ease of commuting in Cape Town. "As such, the plan states that minibus taxis will provide on-demand services in future MyCiTi service roll-outs and will transport commuters to stations and stops from where they can transfer to a MyCiTi trunk route,” Herron said.
