Their cases were all postponed on Wednesday to September 6, and the Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum said they were mobilising for that day. Keith Bird and another man accused of raping a five-year-old girl are among those set to appear. On Wednesday, Bird appeared for a bail application, which was first delayed because his attorney, Afzal Vallie, was not in court. After a recess, Vallie made it to the court and confirmed he had received a summary of the case and would go over it with his client. The bail application was later postponed by magistrate  Alvira Bezuidenhout to October 18. Bird will remain in custody at the Pollsmoor Correctional Centre. He has been charged with the murder of Aniesa Bardien, two counts of rape that took place in 2014 and last year, and intimidation and extortion that took place last year. A 49-year-old man also appeared, for the rape of a five-year-old girl. The man is not able to be named as he still has to appear for an identification parade, which was again postponed as he was assaulted yet again in jail. His case was postponed until September 6. The chairperson of the Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum, Joanie Fredericks, said they would continue coming to the trials in a show of support. “We feel we are satisfied that the case was delayed by the State, so they make sure that the investigation is done properly. With regard to the Bird case, it’s clear that he and his defence are playing delaying tactics," she said. Fredericks said they were also trying to bring cold cases onto the roll, so that all victims were afforded justice. She said they urged victims of old cases to come forward and report them. Fredericks said Bird, the 49-year-old and one other man would appear at the court. The other man stands accused of raping his nine-year-old daughter. Cape Argus
