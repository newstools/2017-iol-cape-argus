Cape Town - A 49-year-old Rocklands resident made his first appearance in the Mitchells Plain Magistrate's Court on Wednesday for the rape of a five-year-old neighbour. The case was postponed to August 30. The accused, who had a bruised face, told the court, via his defence attorney, that he had been assaulted and suffered injuries to his ribs, face and arms.

Supporters packed the courtroom after protesting outside, saying enough is enough. The little girl's great-uncle and great-grandfather, whose names are being withheld to protect the victim's identity, said they hoped justice would be served. They said they and the little girl were still traumatised. "At night she wakes up shaking and is still very traumatised. She has been discharged from hospital and recovering at home."    The girl's mother and grandmother were taking it particularly hard, they said, adding they had to take the grandmother to hospital for observation. "If I could, I would strangle him (the suspect) with my own two hands, but we will let the law take its course and hope that we get justice."    The Mitchell's Plain Crisis Forum attended the hearing, along with supporters. Chairperson Joanie Fredericks said they had had enough.   "Government will have to listen to us when we say that we no longer want to see rapists and killers walking in our streets, but I want the community to stay calm for her justice, and let justice take its course."  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
