Cape Town fire and rescue spokesperson Theo Layne said the fire started at about 2.32am and was finally extinguished at 7.30am yesterday. “Six fire engines, two water tankers and one rescue vehicle (36 firefighters) responded to a fire in Pooke se Bos in Pooke Road, Rylands, where one male sustained fatal burns.” Disaster Risk spokesperson Charlotte Powell said the Disaster Risk Management Centre made an assessment  and found 52 dwellings were destroyed, leaving 127 people affected. “The Mustadafin Foundation will provide humanitarian relief like hot meals, food parcels and blankets. "Various City services are on site. Solid Waste is removing fire debris and informal settlements will issue fire kits to residents to rebuild dwellings. No emergency sheltering has been activated.” One of the survivors, Willem Steenekamp, 43, said everything happened so fast that he chose to save his family first, and then his furniture. “I still cannot believe the whole block burnt out. When I woke up I just saw fire everywhere and I took my three children. Everything burned, including my ID, their certificates and all. There was nothing we could really do. We don't know how it started, the fire just spread quickly.” Pooke se Bos community leader Mieta Hofstander said the fire started at the house where the man died and was caused by a candle.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
