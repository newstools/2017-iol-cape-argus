The competition takes place in October in Johannesburg. The club has not qualified for the World Age Group Competition in Belgium yet, and will know only after the South African Gym Games. Wasabi Sports Club founder and chairperson Wayne Samuels said none of the members in the club had qualified for the competition yet. “Only after the South African Gym Games will we know that,” he said. The club, which was started in 2011, has grown its membership from 13 children to 169. Samuels said they were the only club where the children don't pay membership fees. “I decided to start the club when I saw the enormous talent at schools. These children are truly talented and they are really committed. Some of them walk as far as 5km daily to be here for practice. “Initially 32 children qualified for the South African Gym Games competition, but due to a lack of funds, only 28 of them can go. We fund-raise throughout the year, and some parents could not afford to send their children to the competition in Johannesburg due to funding. Besides the travelling fees and other costs for the competition, parents also have to buy tracksuits and leotards, which are expensive,” he said. Another founder member of the club, Salaamah Davids, added there was immense talent in the club. “These kids have these natural talents for this sport and are so hard-working. We started the club with only four mats and they had to practise outside on the grass,” she said. Roneek Thys, 16, who is one of the young coaches, said she joined the club in 2011. “I was only seven years old back then and I have learnt a lot since then. Now I teach the little ones in the group acrobatic gymnastics. It is so much fun and I enjoy it,” she said. Cape Argus
