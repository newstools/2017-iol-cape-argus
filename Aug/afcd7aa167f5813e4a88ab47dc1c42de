Cape Town - The Labour Court in Cape Town ruled on Thursday that two top cops, major generals Peter Jacobs and Jeremy Vearey, should be reinstated with cost into their previous positions. Vearey and Jacobs approached the court following their "demotion" last year in June, allegedly at the orders of former acting National Police Commissioner Khomotso Phahlane’s office. Jacobs, who held the position of Western Cape crime intelligence head, was demoted to Wynberg Cluster Commander. Vearey, who held the position of Western Cape deputy provincial police commissioner, was meanwhile shunted to Cluster Commander of Cape Town central. In Thursday's judgment, the court ruled that both Jacobs and Vearey should be reinstated to their former positions. Reacting to this, Vearey said: "This not just a victory for us but also for the the ordinary constable in the police." Jacobs added to this, saying: "We are elated at the decision [and the fact that the] rules that protect the working class were followed." Vearey, who was essentially the Western Cape’s head of detectives, has been a controversial figure in policing circles for his unorthodox methods in fighting crime while cluster commander in Mitchells Plain. He, along with Jacobs, were also mentioned in Western Cape Premier Helen Zille's autobiography, Not Without A Fight, where she identified Vearey and Jacobs, as “former Umkhonto we Sizwe operative(s)”.
