Cape Town - Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) has closed its Cape Town campus following protest action on Monday morning. It is believed that protesters started a fire in an office of the multi-purpose hall, and staff as well as students were forced out of buildings. Students took to social media to complain that the protest and the cancellation of campus activities got in the way of their studies as there were exam sessions and tests that were meant to be written on Monday. "In the interests of everyoneâ€™s safety classes and other activities on that campus have been cancelled and staff have been encouraged to work from home for today only," said acting Vice-Chancellor Dr Chris Nhlapo in a statement. The University assured students that the other campuses will not be affected.    The university said that normal operations will continue on Tuesday. IOL
