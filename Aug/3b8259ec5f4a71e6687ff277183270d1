The concert was sponsored by Independent Media in collaboration with Good Hope FM. All proceeds will go towards those who were affected by the Cape storm and Knysna fire. Headline acts at the event included: Chad Saaiman, Locnville and newly-crowned the Voice SA winner Craig Lucas. Audience members also had the opportunity to see some of their favourite Good Hope FM presenters and even rub shoulders with them throughout the night. The show was MC’d by afternoon express presenter and radio host Danilo Acquisto along with Expresso presenter Leigh-Anne Williams. Cape Town mayor Patricia de Lille has thrown her weight behind the benefit concert. “There has been a remarkable outpouring of help and concern for those affected by the storm and the Knysna fire and it is heart-warming to know that the acts of goodwill continue with the United in Hope Benefit Concert,” De Lille said.
