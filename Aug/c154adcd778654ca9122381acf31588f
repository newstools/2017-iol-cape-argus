Lee-Aan Diedricks, 25, said they needed bins, not the plastic bags they were given by the City of Cape Town. “People will keep on dumping because these plastics are not enough. We need bins like other communities have bins. "The sad part is our children often get sick and even my friend’s child had diarrhoea, and some had chickenpox as they play next to this dump. "As the community, we need to understand we are not being done a favour by the government when we are given services, it is our right. No human or animal deserves to stay in a place like this where rats run everywhere.” Ward 48 councillor Magedien Davids said they would start a programme "where they will be educating the community about pollution and the consequences". "The City is doing its job. The community gets about two large plastics where they can throw their rubbish and it is collected twice in a week." Cape Argus
