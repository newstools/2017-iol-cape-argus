Being ambushed by hijackers while entering your property is one of those worst nightmare scenarios, but the Midrand couple in this video managed to save their skins through some very quick and decisive action. The CCTV footage below, posted on YouTube by Crime Watch, shows the couple entering their driveway in their white Range Rover. The woman in the passenger seat then steps out of the car to try and catch their dog, while the hijackers sneak up behind them. Despite this distraction, the woman immediately notices what’s going on and quickly jumps back into the SUV, after which the driver makes a very hasty escape.   The hijackers thankfully then appear to give up on the pursuit, getting back into the car and driving off, but not in any kind of hurry. The Range Rover’s female passenger later posted about her ordeal on the eblockwatch Facebook page: “God's Protection is amazing!! Three men in a golden C-Class Mercedes tried to hijack us as we arrived home just after 13h21 today. Roger's quick thinking got us away quickly and safely!” ALSO READ IOL Motoring
