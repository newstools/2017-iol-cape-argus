Cape Town - It appears the city's rental housing stock is being used for more than just putting a roof over people's heads. The City of Cape Town's Law Enforcement Social Housing Unit, tasked with ensuring residents in the city's rental housing stock live in a safe environment, discovered that some homes are being used as drug dens and havens for merchants. "The City's Law Enforcement, Social Housing Unit who is charged with ensuring that tenants in the City's rental housing stock live in an environment free of crime and grime effected two arrests over the past two days," law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason said. "(On Monday) 31 July 2017 in Elsies River officers arrested a 63-year-old female suspect for possession/dealing in drugs. She was found in possession of 15 packets of tik,  three whole mandrax tablets and 26 dagga stoppe (packs). "(On Tuesday) 1 August 2017 the same officers arrested a 28-year-old suspect in Kewtown, Athlone for possession/dealing in drugs. He was found in possession of 20 packets of tik, 40 whole mandrax tablets and eight half mandrax tablets. "The suspects were taken to Elsies River and Athlone SAPS respectively, where they were charged," Dyason said. He commended the public for providing tip-offs. "Many of these arrests comes from information given to the Unit from ordinary members of the community who have had enough of lawlessness and criminal activity occurring in their neighborhoods and take action by informing the authorities. This type of action is encouraged as crime is better combated through a whole of society approach. Report criminal  activity if you see it. It makes a difference." IOL
