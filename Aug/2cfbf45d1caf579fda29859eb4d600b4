The service recruits 120 people every year to bolster its fight against vegetation fires between November and April. Last week, nearly 
2 000 hopefuls went to the city’s Ndabeni facility to complete a basic fitness assessment, which included a reach test, a 2.4km run, 30 sit-ups within 60 seconds, 30 push-ups within 60 seconds and a 50kg dead-load carry, over 100 m. "I want to congratulate those candidates who persevered and commiserate with those who didn’t make it this time around,” the city’s Safety and Security and Social Services head, JP Smith, said. Out of the 2 000, a total of 846 candidates successfully completed the fitness assessment. Next they will do written and behavioural assessments. The top performers will be offered a contract as seasonal firefighters and start their training on November 1. “We experience anywhere between 6 000 to 9 000 vegetation fires during summer in Cape Town. Our seasonal recruits are crucial to our efforts to protect lives and property during this very busy period,” Smith said. Cape Argus
