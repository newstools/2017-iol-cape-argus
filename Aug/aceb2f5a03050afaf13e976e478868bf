Cape Town - A man was killed and five others injured on Wednesday morning during a four-vehicle crash on the N2 outside Grabouw in the Western Cape. "ER24 paramedics, along with other services, arrived on the scene at 11h04, finding a taxi, truck and bakkie (light pick-up truck) in the middle of the road," ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said. "Another bakkie was found a short distance away on an embankment. "Upon closer inspection, paramedics discovered the body of a man lying outside the taxi, showing no signs of life. It is understood that the man had been pulled from the taxi by the other occupants. "Paramedics assessed the man and found that he had sustained numerous injuries and showed no signs of life. Unfortunately, nothing could be done by paramedics and the man was declared dead. "When paramedics approached the bakkie on the embankment, they found a man lying trapped inside in a critical condition. Rescue services had to use specialized equipment to free the man from the vehicle. "Once freed, paramedics treated the man and provided him with advanced life support interventions.Â Four other patients were found on the scene. Assessment showed that their injuries were only minor. The patients were treated and thereafter transported to various hospitals for urgent treatment. "The cause of the collision is not yet known but local authorities were on the scene for further investigations," Meiring said. Cape Argus
