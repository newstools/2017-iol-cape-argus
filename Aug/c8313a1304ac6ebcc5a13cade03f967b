The Table Bay Hotel and Grand Hotel at Grandwest have plugged into the City’s attempts to save water with this unconventional method. They are taking bath plugs out of their hotel rooms, now only available on request at  reception with the Table Bay Hotel installing a system to reuse bath water. The new methods was implemented after the City Of Cape Town announced level 3 water restrictions. “At The Table Bay, we have intensified our efforts to save and reuse water by implementing two grey water collection systems. The first collection system treats and stores water from our kitchens and a number of our rooms, which is then used to flush the public toilets in our banquet area, staff ablutions and  also water the gardens throughout our hotel. The second collection system recycles backwashed water back into the swimming pool,” said Joanne Selby, general manager at the Table Bay Hotel. Guests had been supportive. The Table Bay Hotel is the ultimate five-star luxury accommodation in Cape Town’s Waterfront. “Our strategy is to maintain the current system and improve on the water reduction targets in the future. Water conservation is a cause that is close to our hearts and we have a long-term commitment,” Selby said.  “We have noticed that many hotel guests are not aware of the drought. Perhaps more emphasis can be done for guests arriving in Cape Town.” Hotel staff had also become more conscious when using water. The Grand Hotel at Grand West Casino has also rolled out a plan to reduce water consumption.  “Bath plugs are only available from reception. Water flow reducers have been fitted to shower heads. Basins have aerators fitted. Towels can be reused. The new methods were not received with open arms at first, the hotel said. “Some guests found it annoying, but most have been very understanding.”  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
