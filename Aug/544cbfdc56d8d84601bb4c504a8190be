Cape Town - A driving instructor on his way to meet a client who was en route to completing their driving licence has been arrested for drunken driving. The instructor was pulled over on Thursday morning and found to be more than 12 times over the legal limit. "This morning, at around 7.15am, a member of the Ghost Unit spotted a vehicle belonging to a driving school driving on the shoulder of the N2 incoming between Bhunga Avenue and Jan Smuts Drive. The driver refused to stop and the officer eventually forced him to a standstill. "During a sobriety test, the driver was initially unable to blow into the breathalyser and when he eventually did, the reading was 1.34 mg per 100ml of blood â€“ more than 12 times the legal limit. "The suspect, driving instructor, was arrested and taken to Athlone police station. At the time of his arrest, he had been on route to Gallows Hill Driving Licence Testing Centre to meet a client who was due to complete their driving licence test. "With a reading like that, it appears the instructor should have been the one passing out. Sadly, it is no laughing matter and is an example of the kind of contempt people have for law and order. "Much of this rests on the fact that the City struggles to get convictions on drunk driving cases, particularly because of weaknesses within the criminal justice system. These are weaknesses we are addressing with the National Prosecuting Authority and the Department of Justice," Smith said. Cape Argus
