On Monday, about 100 people joined the Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum as it hosted a special unveiling ceremony at Stacha’s home in Matroosberg Street, Tafelsig. Friends of the 11-year-old wore white T-shirts with her face printed on them. “Although we were celebrating her, it was very sad. I just bust into tears when I saw her friends. I know how much they miss her. I am still in the healing process, but it’s hard. As a mother you will never get over this, especially if your child was taken from you like this. Every day I am learning to accept she is really gone and it feels like it happened yesterday. I have met many people through her and I am able to help other mothers like me,” said Sandy Markgraff, Stacha’s mom. Even though it was an unveiling ceremony, everyone enjoyed a slice of cake. Markgraff’s sister and Stacha’s teachers said a few words before placing a plaque at her house. Tershia Harris, who turned 29, is a social worker and a member of the Mitchells Plain Crisis Forum. “This was to bring a level of healing to family, friends and the community at large. I live here and I know the impact the murder had on other children, so I felt I had to do something to honour her. I saw the excitement when I told her mother what I was planning and  although it opened up the fresh wounds she was happy.” Stacha’s body was found behind the bushes in an open field on March 28.
