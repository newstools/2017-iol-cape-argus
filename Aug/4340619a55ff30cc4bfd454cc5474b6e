Cape Town - Tafelsig community members alerted law enforcement officers that a girl was being raped. The City’s Safety and Security spokesperson Wayne Dyason said that when the officers approached the scene the suspect fled. “The officers took the victim to SAPS in Mitchells Plain where the brave young girl informed the officers she knew the suspect and showed the officers where he lived in Tafelsig Mitchells Plain. SAPS officers then arrested him and in the process also found him in possession of an illegal firearm,” said Dyason. He said it was discovered that the suspect was HIV-positive. The victim has been admitted to hospital. Mitchells Plain Community Policing Forum spokesperson Abe Isaacs said that police are investigating the matter and that the family and young girl will be given support during this time. * This is a developing story Cape Times
