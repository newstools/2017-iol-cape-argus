But then there’s the Burner Restaurant in Bellville that takes me back to my childhood home and I can smell the aromas filling the kitchen while my gran cooked a sumptious curry. A bunny chow spilling over with succulent pieces of lamb, dripping with gravy is a promise they make and one that they keep. It’s not called the Burner for fun, the curry is pungent but well worth the sinus clearing experience. If you know a good bunny chow then you must try the Burner, it will satisfy the itch. I have been back a few times and I am happy to report that the standard has not changed. Aside from the bunny chow, their rotis are light and fresh, as is the sugars beans curry and their breyani. It is an authentic Durban curry house and worth the trek from Hout Bay when the craving calls. The eatery is simple, tables, chairs and great food. It is not a restaurant pretending to compete with the best of Cape Town but as far as delicious food goes, it is up there with the best of them. Cape Argus
