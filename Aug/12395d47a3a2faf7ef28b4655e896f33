Train driver Luyanda Qoyi had been at the Bonteheuwel station on Tuesday at 1.22pm, waiting for authority to pass signals, when three armed robbers approached the train and began robbing commuters of their valuables. The robbers were chased away by a Prasa security guard, said Untu. Untu said there were no armed guards available to escort the driver when he had to leave with his train on route to Bellville. The union’s general secretary, Steve Harris, said the attack follows Prasa's appointment of 56 armed guards to escort train drivers and metro guards on the Central Line. “This comes after another three Untu members were attacked by five armed men on Monday at about 9.15pm. According to them, the five suspects got on to the train at Mbekweni Station in Paarl on the Northern Line. “Untu members are complaining about increased criminal activities on the surrounding railway routes after Prasa implemented armed guards on the Central Line. It's a catch-22 situation. Irrespective of the outcome of the pending court case, drastic measures are urgently needed to combat this crime spree,” said Harris. Meanwhile, Metrorail regional manager Richard Walker said at the standing committee for transport and public works that the company suffered a loss in 2015 due to arson and vandalism. “The loss of 101 train carriages with an estimated replacement value of R312 million is the main contributor to the region operating with 60% of its fleet, punctuality dropping by more than 20% and cancellations soaring.”  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
