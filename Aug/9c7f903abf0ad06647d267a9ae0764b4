“I used to have 24 taps on my farm and now only have one. From this tap, we only use 50 litres of potable water a day,” Brian Pick said. “And five people use the water for drinking, cooking, to shower and for the washing of dishes. “My horses and dogs drink the borehole water which goes into two 5 000 litre water tanks. I put floaters and alum into the water which takes out the iron and clears the water.” “I started doing this three months ago, and my water bill was reduced from R2 600 monthly to zero. Each water tank cost R5 000, but it was worth the money which I spent,” Pick added. The Western Cape is in a drought and the City of Cape Town has implemented Level 4b water restrictions. Cape Argus
