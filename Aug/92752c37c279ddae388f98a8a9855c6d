Cape Town - The current dam storage levels are currently at 34.2% but useable water levels remains low at 24.2%. The City of Cape has revealed that the collective consumption is sitting at 599 million litres of water per day, but this is far to high with daily usage being 99 million litres above the target of 500 million litres. Water consumption must be brought down to ensure that Cape Town can get through as much of the summer as possible, towards winter 2018. With summer slowly approaching, reducing consumption still remains absolutely vital. "We must introduce supply augmentation schemes," said the City’s Mayco member for Water and Waste Services, Xanthea Limberg. "Various processes must be finalised pertaining to the procurement. We are doing everything that we can to ensure that Cape Town survives the drought, but that we also adapt so that we can thrive irrespective of a drought as part of our New Normal approach to the unpredictability of climatic conditions," she said. The City also reminded residents to reduce water flow on their property through adjusting their private stopcocks or water control taps. Water supplied by the City remains safe to drink and is tested in accordance with safety standards. For information on how to meet the 87-litre per day usage requirement, residents should visit the water restrictions page on the City’s website and utilise our water calculator.
