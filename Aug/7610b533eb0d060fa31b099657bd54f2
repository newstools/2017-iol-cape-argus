CAPE TOWN - Our golden boy has done it again! Wayde van Niekerk crushed the rest of the field to successfully defend his 400m title at the IAAF World Championships in London on Tuesday night. It was a fast start from the 25-year-old South African, who quickly moved away from the rest of the field in the first 200m. He maintained his pace until hitting the last bend, and then turned up the heat as he shot down the final straight to put a few metres on the rest of the field. Van Niekerk was so far ahead that he had time to slow down in the last 30 metres, presumably to save himself for the 200m as he attempts to do the sprint double. Van Niekerk won in 43.98 seconds, with Steven Gardiner of the Bahamas claiming silver in 44.41 and Abdalelah Haroun of Qatar third in 44.48.   Now it is all about the 200m, where Van Niekerk cruised through his heat on Monday. He will run in his semi-final on Wednesday night at 9.55pm SA time, along with Akani Simbine. @ashfakmohamed IOL Sport
