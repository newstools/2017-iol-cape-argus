Cape Town -Â The Student Representative Council of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology (CPUT) has condemned the student protest which broke out on Monday. SRC Secretary General Mbaliyezwe Madikizela said they have been inundated by emails of concerned parents and students. The protest on the Cape Town campus caused the university to shut its doors for the day. Classes would resume on Tuesday, she said. Some students are proptesting over the lack of student accommodation in residences. However, Madikizela said it was unfair of the students who may not meet the residence criteria to protest against the lack of accommodation when there are aleady at least 1000 students who meet the criteria but have as yet not been placed.

"Students from Cape Town Campus were forcefully removed out of classes and exams and tests by the very students who don't meet the requirements to be in student residences," Madikizela said. "We condemn this hooliganism behavior of students. This is really unacceptable behavior by students." Last week The Cape Argus reported about the current student accommodation crisis. The protesting students threatened to occupy a building in Kloof Street where the only female residence is situated.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
