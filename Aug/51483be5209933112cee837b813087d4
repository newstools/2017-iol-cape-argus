The community leader of informal settlement Pholile Park, Mwezi Lugwani, said all these years had been tough for residents. “When it rains we have serious floods here we do not enjoy winter at all. We were told we will be receiving temporary electricity. “We do not know if they are just doing it because we are close to elections now, or if they really want to help. “We believe the City has been giving false information on why we do not get service delivery.” Noloyiso Ntamo, 39, said her children were constantly sick during winter. The City’s Disaster Risk Management’s (DRM) Charlotte Powell said they were preparing to assist those in need. “City Services will provide flood kits, milling and sand,” she said. Cape Argus
