Over the past two weeks, 15 people have been killed in gun and gang-rated violence, in Bishop Lavis. About three months ago four women in Tafelsig, Mitchells Plain, were arrested for the possession of illegal weapons. Last week it was ruled that SAPS Major-Generals Jeremy Vearey and Peter Jacobs should be reinstated to the positions they were demoted from. Vearey was the deputy provincial commissioner: crime detection and Jacobs the provincial head of crime intelligence. It was their investigation that led to the arrest of Colonel Chris Prinsloo who admitted via a plea bargain that he illegally supplied 2000 firearms to gangs. “These firearms had been meant for destruction by SAPS, but were stolen from their stores,” Jacobs said. In Jacobs’ and Vearey’s judgment 1200 illegal weapons were still in circulation in Cape Town. It was part of Vearey’s and Jacobs’ mission to  trace and recover the firearms. After their investigation, it was also revealed that “police officials, of whom three have been arrested, have colluded with gang leaders to facilitate the provision of firearm licences to gangs illegally and fraudulently. Both the investigation of illegal supply of firearms and licences require more time and dedication in order to complete various phases of the key investigations,” they stated. Vearey said they want to start working as soon as possible. “We know what is happening on the Cape Flats and we want to start working at combating these crimes. The Cape Flats is where we are needed the most,” he said.  rusana.philander@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
