The men, aged 30 and 19, made their first appearance at Malmesbury Magistrate’s Court in Swartland. Yvonne Wilson, 24, described how her ex-boyfriend looked at the family and smiled while taking the stand. “My community came out to support us. The court was full as very one wanted to see him and see if he regretted what he did. “I saw him smiling, I saw a person with no regret or apologetic for what he did. I still can not believe this is really happening; it feels like a dream I can wake up from. “My mother is heartbroken and angry. It was not a good feeling seeing him after what he did to me and my family, even the community and people from other places are angry.” Wilson said the father of her ex-boyfriend had called and consoled them. But she said they had not gone to the house and apologised as “maybe 
they are ashamed of what their son did”. Kaithlyn’s father, Johnie Cloete, 37, said he could not go to court as he had to go back to work, in Mamre. “Yvonne called me and told me how he smiled and I am very angry. I really hope they will be sentenced to life. “He still has the nerve to smile after what he put us through. I wish I was there. “I could see at first that it has not really sunk in to Yvonne that our baby is really gone. I think it is slowly now. “Princess (Kaithlyn) was our joy.” The police and the department of social services have expressed concern at the rise in the killing of children in the Western Cape. More than 30 have been killed since the beginning of the year. Kaithlyn’s body was found on a farm in the area on Sunday following an extensive search 
by the community and police. She had been reported missing by her grandmother earlier in the day. Cape Argus
