Cape Town - Two men were sentenced in the Bellville Magistrateâ€™s Court earlier this week after being convicted on a charge of fraud relating to a learner licence test earlier this year. Just after 10am on Wednesday, March 1, 2017, an examiner at the Durbanville Driving Licence Testing Centre (DLTC) raised the alarm after noticing that one of the people completing the test was not the original applicant. The DLTC manager investigated and discovered that the applicant (who was waiting outside) had asked a friend to write the test on his behalf as he has a sight issue and was not adequately prepared to complete the written test himself. The friend also completed the eye test. The two suspects were arrested on a charge of fraud and detained at the Durbanville police station. The case against them was finalised this week when they were each sentenced to a fine of R6 000 or 12 months imprisonment, of which R3 000 or 6 months imprisonment was suspended for 5 years, with conditions attached. The City can confirm that both men paid the fines. "This was quite an expensive lesson for these two men and now they also have criminal records to boot, proving once again that crime does not pay," mayoral committee member for saftey and security; and social services JP Smith said. "While bribes are not uncommon, this incident was on another level altogether and I thank the vigilant examiner who lifted the lid on the scam. I know that acquiring a licence to drive can be a taxing experience for many people, but I appeal to the public to stick with the longer route instead as shortcuts could have far-reaching consequences down the line."
