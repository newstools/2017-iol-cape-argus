Dr Alecia Samuels, whose thesis focused on teenage pregnancies, said that the issue has become so prevalent in impoverished communities that young girls are being encouraged to complete school so their children can have a better future. Poverty, crime and drug abuse are some of the factors which lead to teenage pregnancy, she said. “Young girls who do not get support in raising their children are likely not to complete school. “Teenage pregnancy is common in South Africa. Nearly a third of women have children before they reach the age of 20. Young mothers also say they struggle financially because in most cases the fathers are absent. I want to encourage young moms to complete their schooling as this will help their children to have a better future. “Pregnancy and parenthood are important issues for schools, learners and parents to acknowledge and address. Due to the school environment, learners and the community are affected by it,” Samuels said. An 18-year-old girl who fell pregnant earlier this year while in matric, and who wanted to remain anonymous, said it was a difficult year for her. “When I got pregnant my parents were very upset. It was my final year in school and they felt that I disappointed them. I wanted to complete my matric and attended school just before I had the baby. But after the baby was born, things became very difficult. "My parents refused to help me with the baby. I now have to raise him on my own and cannot go back to school. And if I do not find a good job I will not be able to provide for him,” she said. According to research by the National Department of Education’s General Household Survey Focus on Schooling in 2015, “pregnancy remains a major barrier for girls attending educational institutions”. The pregnancy rate is the highest in grades 10-12.  rusana.philander@inl.co.za  CAPE ARGUS
