This year, a record 92 teams from various schools across the Cape were split into 23 groups of four schools each, before competing to get to the knock-out stages.    The 64 teams put their wits to the test at 16 schools across the peninsula with only the top two teams from each group proceeding to Round 2. The quiz, which is in its ninth year, encourages high school pupils to test their knowledge of news and current affairs based on information found within the pages of the Cape Argus. Topics include politics, sport, entertainment and news.    High school teams are not only competing for their share of R200 000 in cash, but also other prizes. Cape Argus editor Aziz Hartley said: “The Cape Argus Food Lovers Market High Schools Quiz offers not only the chance for pupils and their schools to win big, but also an opportunity for all of us to see the talents of our future leaders.” Director of Food Lovers Market Niresh Mangaru said: "We want to empower the leaders of tomorrow. "It’s exciting and we want make sure they not only learn, but practice what they learn, allowing them to broaden their general knowledge." Cape Argus
