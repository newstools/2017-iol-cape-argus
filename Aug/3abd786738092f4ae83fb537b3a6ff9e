Each bag of Tru-Cape apples purchased contributed towards providing 283 648 meals to hungry children in the Western Cape in May, by raising nearly R250 000. World Hunger Day was launched by The Hunger Project in 2011 and aims to inspire people all over the world to show their solidarity and support for the women, men and children who are hungry on a daily basis as a result of poverty. More than 795 million people worldwide go to bed hungry each night and the focus of this year’s campaign is good nutrition. Says Andrew Millson, head of Earth Lovers: “At Food Lover’s Market we aspire to a South Africa that is hunger free. With 14 million South Africans going hungry every day, Food Lover’s Market - through its Earth Lovers pillar - wants to make a sustainable, impactful difference in the communities in which we operate. A big part of this is to address hunger through our partnership with FoodForward SA. "The goals of the Hunger Project aligned with our company ethos, and through our partnership with Tru-Cape Apples and FoodForward SA we have not only managed to shine a spotlight on these issues, but raise a significant amount of money that has been donated to FoodForward SA, enabling them to continue with the hugely impactful work they do." Tru-Cape managing director Roelf Pienaar says: “We take our responsibility for the livelihoods of 15200 people involved in our business very seriously as we all rely on the successful sale of South African apples and pears to put food on our tables. The good news is that Tru-Cape apples are energy rich and nutrient dense and a perfectly portable food which is affordable to many.” FoodForward SA has supplied 14 500 000 meals in the last year and Food Lover’s Market are proud to be in partnership with FoodForward SA. Each Food Lover’s Market store has partnered with a local charity, mostly aimed at children and have contributed towards 1.5million meals, in the last year.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
