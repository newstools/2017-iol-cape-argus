Xanthea Limberg, the mayoral committee member for informal settlements, utilities and energy,  explained that their water inspectorate had already visited the areas with the highest water usage to find out why their consumption was so high. “We found that businesses were run  from the premises and a lot of people were also staying on the properties, which led to the high usage.” Limberg warned people not to drink untreated water from natural springs. “We recommend that people do not drink water from springs. "This water has not gone through a treatment process. "People drink this water at their own risk. Spring water can be used for other purposes, but not for drinking,” she said. One of the springs where people regularly collect water is at the SAB Newlands spring. One of the people who came to collect water there and wanted to remain anonymous, said: “There is nothing wrong with this water. We drink it and use it  for cooking."
