Cape Town - Shoe City has been forced to apologise to the Muslim community after the name "Muhammad" appeared on the sole of a shoe and its corresponding box. The image of the shoe name was circulated on social media and eventually caught the attention of the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC). "A post making the rounds via social media about a shoe that displayed a price tag with the nameÂ Muhammad on its sole and outside of the shoeâ€™s box reached the Muslim Judicial Council (SA) overÂ the weekend," the MJC said in a statement. Shoe City managing director Johan Wasserval met with MJC presidentÂ Shaykh Irafaan Abrahams, the MJCâ€™s Executive
Council and Mufti Taha Karaan. "Mr Wasserval was given fair opportunity to present his case and gave a detailed explanation of howÂ the improper use of the name of our most Beloved Prophet, Muá¸¥ammad (Peace Be Upon Him) cameÂ to be. "The situation arose after Shoe City (a member of the Pepkor Group) implemented a StyleÂ Reference Name for shoes instead of a Stock Keeping Unit (SKU) number. The list of names wasÂ provided by their IT specialists who Googled the most popular menâ€™s names. "Mr Wasserval tendered his sincerest apology for their ignorance on when the name Muá¸¥ammad canÂ be used and when not. "The MJC (SA) accepted Mr Wasservalâ€™s apology and was assured that all shoes carrying this price tagÂ will be recalled and a small committee be established to investigate the list of names being used in future labeling opportunities," the MJC said. The shoes drew outrage from some members of the Muslim community.
