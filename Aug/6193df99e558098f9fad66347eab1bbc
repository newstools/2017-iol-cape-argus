A 22-year-old man was arrested near Klapmuts. It’s alleged that he and three accomplices were in the process of vandalising a train carriage when the MPS teams arrested him. The man’s accomplices fled and he was handed over to the Klapmuts SAPS and charged in terms of the Criminal Matters Amendment Act. “This is the 18th arrest in eight weeks, proving we are serious about reducing unbridled vandalism,” said regional manager Richard Walker. "Vandalism on trains reduces the region's fleet by 60-70 carriages a month. Our commuters and employees suffer needlessly as a result,” he said. MPS teams conduct inspections and search and seize operations daily. They focus on crime prevention infringements such as travelling between carriages, keeping doors open in transit, boarding or exiting moving trains, and fare evasion. Metrorail offers a reward of up to R25000 for information leading to a
