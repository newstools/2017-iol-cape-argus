The partnership has resulted in the schools’ improving results dramatically over the last three years of the five-year partnership Joe Slovo High and Sizimisele High Schools in Khayelitsha, Khanyolwethu High in Strand, Malibu High and Forest Heights High in Blue Downs, and Kleinvlei High in Eerste River all saw their Stem matric results improve over the past three years. Joe Slovo High, a school engulfed with crime and gang-related violence,  achieved a 100% matric pass rate last year. Before the company’s generous donation to the schools, they also provided three science kits per school, each to the value of R20000. In addition to building the Stem culture at these schools, Thales allocated R1m towards bursaries to six deserving matriculants to study at any university in South African in any science, technology or engineering field.
