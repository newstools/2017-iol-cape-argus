Cape Town - The Cape Town CBD is on lockdown with several streets around Parliament closed ahead of Tuesday’s motion of no confidence debate in President Jacob Zuma. Already outside Parliament, a few hundred DA supporters have gathered, waving placards calling for Zuma to go and blaring loud music from a van. There is also a strong police presence inside and outside the Parliament precinct. The metro police from the City of Cape Town are also monitoring the situation in the streets that have been blocked. ANC MPs have started arriving with some of the ministers including Minister of Finance Malusi Gigaba and his deputy, Sifiso Buthelezi, who were seen walking to their offices. International Relations Minister Maite Nkoana-Mashabane was also seen going to her office. Cope leader Mosiuoa Lekota and EFF secretary-general Godrich Gardee were also in the Parliamentary precinct mobilising support. Parliament is a hive of activity with staff from the institution preparing for Tuesday afternoon’s vote. Speaker Baleka Mbete has outlined procedures that will be followed in conducting the vote. Opposition parties had indicated on Monday they wanted to meet with ANC chief whip Jackson Mthembu ahead of the vote to discuss the voting procedure. IFP chief whip Narend Singh had said this was to ensure no one will know how MPs voted, even if it was a secret ballot.
