Cape Town - Due to severely strong winds causing the cancellation of the 2017 event, the organisers of the Cape Town Cycle Tour - the world's largest timed cycle race - have decided to move the starting point. The race, which normally starts at the Cape Town Civic Centre on Hertzog Boulevard, will begin next year in the Grand Parade precinct. David Bellairs, Director of Marketing, Media and Sponsorship said the decision was not an easy one to make.    "There were many factors that we had to take into consideration before making the decision. "In the 40 years of the Cycle Tour we have had only three years of severe wind. This year we were incredibly unfortunate," he said. Bellairs said those who were to participate in this year's race - which had to be cancelled due to strong winds - would receive preferential treatment. "Those who received their race number and registration will be able to skip the entire process and will be able to partake in next year's event." The City Of Cape Town's mayoral committee Â member for safety and security; and social services JP Smith said the City had decided to invest heavily in the Grand Parade. "The City has decided that we will be investing in the Grand Parade - it's a huge asset for us," Smith said.    Questions were also raised regarding the traders on the Grand Parade and whether they would be forced to move.    "We are currently in talks with the City regarding the traders. We are keeping in mind that we want to give small local businesses a opportunity," Bellairs said. Cape Argus
