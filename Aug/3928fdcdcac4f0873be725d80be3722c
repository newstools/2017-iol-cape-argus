The annual school quiz tests the general knowledge and news consumption of pupils. Each week schools go head to head to stand a chance to win a share of R200 000. Every Monday for the knock-out rounds, pupils, teachers and parents will be joining Cape Town TV’s youth programme, Ekse, on Channel 263 at 4pm. On today’s show, a teacher, librarian and parent from the Cape Academy of Maths will be on the show discussing ways of incorporating the whole household and how parents can assist their children in studying. They will also be talking about ways to improve spelling. Winners of today’s school quiz challenge will be on next week’s show. On that show they will talk about how technology can help with studying and assist with stress-relieving techniques. CAPE ARGUS
