Cape Town - Monday is the last quarter-final round of the Cape Argus Food Lovers Market High Schools Quiz. The last 16 teams standing will be battling it out at four venues across the city for a spot in the semi-finals to be contested on August 19. The finals will be held on Saturday at Oaklands High School in Lansdowne at 2pm. The quiz, now in its ninth year, sees the teams vying for prize money in excess of R250 000. Defending champions South Peninsula High has three teams in the quarter-final round, with Mondale High, Maitland High, Steenberg High and Spine Road High with two teams each. Other finalists include Rhodes High, Sea Point High, Heathfield High, Fairbairn College and Rylands High with one team each. South Peninsula High, Rhodes High, Sea Point High and Steenberg High will host the last quarter-final. The top eight teams then progress to the semi-finals which will be contested at the weekend. Anticipation is mounting as this year’s winners will also receive a free online bursary and one of the schools in the Top 16 will receive a bursary valued at R150 000 for a deserving student. The excitement is shared by anchor sponsors Food Lovers Market. "We are passionate about supporting the development of educated and well-informed future leaders – this is why we have partnered with the Cape Argus for the fourth consecutive year," Coastal Operations Director for Food Lovers Market, Niresh Mangaru said. "We’d like to wish all the contestants well over the next few weeks. We’re as excited as their families and schools to see who the winning team will be this year."
