This comes after frustrated residents complained they had been waiting for their houses for a very long time, after initiating the housing project. “The funding needed to conclude this project has been secured. City officials have assured the residents that the target date for commencing with the construction of the top structures remains October,” said mayoral committee member for transport and urban renewal, Brett Herron. The 49 families currently staying in backyards said the City had previously told them the project was not budgeted for. Ruo Emoh Housing Project member Adnaan Hendricks said: “We have so far complied with all the many things they asked. One was that we should build a boundary wall around the site, which we funded ourselves. It cost R480 000. We’ve since built the roads, installed the electricity, the stormwater pipes and the sewerage systems, but because of the project being halted so many times, all these things had to be reinstalled.” The project is part of the government’s Breaking New Ground subsidised housing.
