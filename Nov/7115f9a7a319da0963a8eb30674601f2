It seems almost as if some of the law enforcers seem not to know how or when to apply these laws. What brought this subject to the fore is when I see on media channels how blatantly law enforcers are being attacked, threatened or simply ignored in the execution of their duties. But let us also look at the other side of this issue. Do law enforcers know how or what laws are applicable in different criminal acts? This question came to mind this past week as we saw how people attacked and took away a law enforcement officer’s firearm in front of a church. The officer could have been seriously injured or even killed. Why did he allow himself to be in such danger? In my police career I was in dangerous situations where I knew what offences the perpetrators were committing. I knew the laws with regard to my safety and the safety of others, and so, when occasions arose, I shot and wounded the criminals, in line with the law. As a retired police officer, I realised from my police college days that a police officer has a very powerful weapon in the fight against crime. That is why it is so vitally important that all law enforcement officials become legal-wise on how one applies and enforces order. The legislation can also be amended to ensure law and order in the land is upheld. To quote Robert F Kennedy: “The glory of justice and the majesty of law are created not just by the constitution - nor by the courts, nor by the officers of the law, or by the lawyers - but by the men and women who constitute our society, who are the protectors of the law as they are themselves be protected by the law.” * Keith Alfred Adolph Blake is a Cape Town resident from Ottery ***The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
