Raees Miller from Paarl needs your help to raise R25 000 for a Kung Fu trip to Hong Kong next year. The 14-year-old from Amstelhof, Paarl has been doing Kung Fu fighting since February last year. And now he has been invited to attend the 2018 Hong Kong International Kung Fu Championships taking place in Ma On Shan, in Hong Kong in March. Managed Raees is one of 18 kids from the Western Cape who will be representing South Africa at the prestigious tournament. His mother, Nabeelah Miller, says funding has been an issue and they have only managed to raise R2 000 this far. “Half of the R25 000 has to be in by the end of November and the rest by the end of January. I have been trying my best, we have made lists for people to fill in and this weekend I am also going to sell braai plates to try and make the money. I have so far only raised R2 000. The R25 000 includes monies for the flights, food and accommodation,” Nabeelah explains. The mother says her eldest son has made her extremely proud with his achievement and dedication to his sport. This will be the first time a Youth Squad from the Western Cape and South Africa competes at an international Kung Fu tournament. “I am so proud of him, and excited. He doesn’t have medals, but I am so happy he was chosen by his coach to represent South Africa at this prestigious tournament,” says Nabeelah. Tournament Raees is a student of former Kung Fu world champion Mohamed Junaid Shafeker, aka MJ Li. “Raees started doing Kung Fu when MJ Li started training children in the area last year for free. My son went to a tournament in Rocklands, Mitchells Plain, in August, and early September I found out he was one of the chosen few for this overseas tournament, which I hope he makes. I wish him well,” Nabeelah adds. If you would like to assist Raees in making his dream a reality, contact Nabeelah on 072 585 5154. Daily Voice
