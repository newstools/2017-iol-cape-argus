There are currently 68 confirmed cases of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI) in the province, but no new confirmed cases, MEC Alan Winde said on Sunday. “State vets are working with farms to disinfect their chicken houses so they can start restocking. Common practice is for sentinel birds to be placed in houses as a method of detecting any trace of the virus. Some farms are already testing sentinels and early reports show that they remain virus-free,” Winde said. He said that since the infection rate had started tapering off the industry was looking at proactive risk management plans. “The industry is already looking at risk management lessons that can be learnt from this outbreak. State vets have put the following in place in respect of restocking: farms are advised to have a full biosecurity audit on the property performed by a veterinarian and address all recommendations and concerns arising from this audit prior to restocking the farm with poultry. “The property is still under quarantine and no birds or products may be permitted to leave the property until the quarantine is lifted. The owner must sign that they understand restocking at this stage is at their own risk and no compensation or incentive will be paid if the birds must be culled due to HPAI,” Winde said. He added that clinical surveillance on the sentinels or restocked poultry must be undertaken during this period. If after the full 42 days since the first disinfection the state veterinarian is satisfied that the property is free from HPAI the quarantine may be lifted.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
