Presenters of masculinity and pride Meant to protect and defend Care for and provide What induces you now to Abuse women, children and infants With vicious assaults and barbaric attacks? What impels you to defeat Those so much weaker than you Who need you, rely on you And trust you to lead the way?   Ah, men When did you lose your way? What made you think it was okay To make women and children pay For your dissolution? When did you decide that alcohol or drugs Was a justifiable excuse For the extent of your descent To degradation?   And if otherwise - even then Do not deny responsibility Against those who should be condemned Do not pretend not to see The culpability Of those who levy brutality Against women and children   Ah men Alleged protectors and defenders.
