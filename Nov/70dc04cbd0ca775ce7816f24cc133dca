The couple, Yusuf Saboodien and Nazeema Lewis, were driving with their daughter, Aisha Lewis, when shots rang out. Yusuf’s mother Faldielah Saboodien said she heard the news of what happened from her granddaughter, who is recovering at the Red Cross Children’s hospital. “He was on his way to the Town Centre and, as the child told me, a white car drove up next to them and the occupants started shooting. Yusuf lost control of the bakkie he was driving. They were already dead when I got there.” Faldielah said her son would have turned 36 in two weeks' time and although she knew he was involved in a gang he was “not all bad”. “He was very jokey and he always came to me when he needed something; he would ask me for R10 or petrol money. He was on tik, but he was a gentle child.” The shooting is believed to be gang-related as it is alleged that Yusuf was a high-ranking member of the Fancy Boys gang. She said they had identified her son’s body at the morgue, but owing to the backlog faced by the province’s mortuaries they were still waiting to receive his body. Yusuf's sister Faranaaz said she was going to miss her brother dearly.   “He was always coming to get food here; every night and he always checked on us. He would ask my sister and mother if we were all right. Losing him is a big loss. No one can help us now.” Police spokesperson FC van Wyk said they were investigating. He said the incident occurred at about 8.30pm on Wednesday. “Anyone with information about the shootings is requested to contact Crime Stop on 0860010111.” - Additional reporting by the Daily Voice Cape Argus
