“The wind conditions resulted in the early closure of many of the 12 designated sites for the discharge of fireworks because of safety considerations. The fire marshal on site at Maiden’s Cove made the decision to close the site as early as 7pm. "A similar decision was made in Tableview at 8:15pm,” mayoral committee member for safety and security JP Smith said. These closures meant an increase in the number of complaints from other open spaces, but also an increase in the number of people at the Strandfontein and Athlone sites. Of the 22 injuries reported, 18 were to children; 15 of the injuries were recorded at Strandfontein Pavilion. A 10-year-old boy sustained an eye injury and was taken to hospital. Another 10-year-old sustained a leg injury in Sarepta and was referred to his GP. All other injured people were treated on site for minor injuries. Just before 11pm, staff confiscated a bakkie-load of illegal fireworks at Athlone stadium. “Away from the designated sites, the City’s Public Emergency Communication Centre fielded 209 calls on the day that were specific to Guy Fawkes and the illegal discharge of fireworks,” Smith said. City staff confiscated hundreds of units of fireworks and issued numerous fines. “This is but an example of the terror many communities endure on Guy Fawkes. "Apart from the disturbance fireworks cause, the behaviour of marauding gangs attacking innocent people is downright criminal,” Smith said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
