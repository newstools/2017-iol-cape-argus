The department has allocated just over R683 million this year to lead society against the scourge of abuse of women and children. “Our message as the government over these 16 Days and beyond is clear: get help and report abuse,” said MEC for Social Development Albert Fritz.  He added that the department prioritises the development and protection of the 1.7 million children and 2.1 million women in the Western Cape. “Through the Children and Families programme and the Victim Empowerment sub-programme (VEP), the department provides key services to women and children at risk 365 days a year,” Fritz said.  The VEP, Children and Families programme receives a combined budget of R683m, which is up R29m from the previous year. It is the largest single funding allocation received. “Events include a  focus on abused people with disabilities,with funded NGO partners working with disabled adults and children.  “There will be a door-to-door awareness session in Paarl on December 4 at the Lover’s Lane Informal Settlement with our funded NGO partners, and the hosting of a gender-based violence workshop on trauma-informed care on December 5, which will see DSD invite all stakeholders such as the police, NPA, NGOs and academics," said Fritz. "We can end the abuse of women and children if we continue to work together and build partnerships with communities.” The public is urged to report any cases of abuse of women and children to the SAPS on 10111 (24-hour service), or by approaching the department's social workers at regional or local offices, or by contacting the DSD hotline on 0800 220 250.   marvin.charles@inl.co.za  For 16 Days of Activism to end violence against women and children, Independent Media will bring you stories behind the statistics.
