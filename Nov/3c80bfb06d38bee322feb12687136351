Cape Town - The investigating officer in the murder case of Khayelitsha mom Aviwe Jam Jam told the Athlone Magistrate's Court that a pair of sneakers taken from one of the men who allegedly helped move her body matched the description of the pair she was wearing when she was last seen alive. The investigating officer, Benjamin Barker, testified that the sneakers, a grey pair of Nike Air Force One, were taken from the man, who is now a State witness. Jam Jam was wearing them on the last day she was seen alive. Her boyfriend, Linda Ntulo, has been charged with her murder. “They matched the description given by the accused of what she had been wearing that day,” Barker said. Ntulo’s defence lawyer, Asghar Mia, challenged Barker on whether he could say with certainty that the sneakers were the exact pair Ntulo was describing. “I cannot say with certainty in court that it is. But they do match the description we were given by the accused,” he replied. Barker said the sneakers had been sent for tests, and they were awaiting the results. He said Jam Jam’s family was not given the chance to identify the sneakers. The court also heard that Ntulo has a pending case at the Cape Town Magistrate's Court for attempted theft which he would be attending on Friday. Barker told the court Ntulo was a member of a gang operating in Khayelitsha, Philippi East and Nyanga, and that he was likely to kill again. He requested that the court deny Ntulo bail, alleging that he had not only abused Jam Jam, but also previous girlfriends, resulting in one spending two months in hospital. Ntulo is also in bail application proceedings for an attempted murder charge at the Khayelitsha Magistrate's Court. He had allegedly beaten Jam Jam’s stepfather. Arguments for the murder charge will be heard on November 20.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
