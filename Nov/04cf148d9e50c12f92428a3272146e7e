Andrika Jacobs, 43, a mom of eight of New Horizon near Pelican Park, spoke exclusively to the Daily Voice after her son, Mikhial, was hospitalised after acid nearly blinded him and burnt a hole in his chest. Mikhial, a Grade 1 pupil at Zeekoevlei Primary, is being treated at Red Cross Children’s Hospital. On 2 November, Mikhial and his siblings were playing in a park near Haroon Street, in Eagle Park. It is believed a 17-year-old boy of New Horizon ordered Mikhial to shake a glass container. The acid bomb exploded in his hands, damaging his eyes, while doctors also found a piece of plastic lodged in his chest. “The doctor said it was near his heart. My child is in a lot of pain and he cannot open his eyes yet. He said he doesn’t want to play outside anymore.” Andrika says she has since gone to the teen’s house and asked him what was in the bomb. “He took a piece of paper and wrote down the ingredients he used,” she says. “He wrote potassium hydroxide, lithium and water. He said he got the items from the lab at school. This child and the mother have shown no remorse for what he did.” No criminal case has been made against the teenager as yet. Andrika says she is still waiting to hear if her son will have any long-term damage. “I have the J88, but the doctor needs to complete it and then I will be going to the police station.” Daily Voice
