Los Angeles - The galaxy far, far away is
expanding further on screen with a new trilogy of "Star Wars"
films outside of the ongoing Skywalker saga, Walt Disney Co
said Thursday, to be overseen by Rian Johnson, the
director of the franchise's upcoming film "The Last Jedi." Johnson, 43, will write and direct the first of a new "Star
Wars" trilogy that will bring new characters and worlds not yet
explored on screen, Disney said. "He’s a creative force, and watching him craft 'The Last
Jedi' from start to finish was one of the great joys of my
career. Rian will do amazing things with the blank canvas of
this new trilogy,” Kathleen Kennedy, president of Lucasfilm,
said in a statement. Disney said no release dates have been set for the new
trilogy. In addition to the new film trilogy, Disney's CEO Bob
Iger said during the company's quarterly earnings call on
Thursday that a "Star Wars" live-action TV series was also being
developed for the company's upcoming streaming service.   Johnson was brought on to write and direct the second film
in Disney's rebooted trilogy of the Skywalker stories, which
George Lucas first brought to screen in 1977. "The Last Jedi," which follows on from 2015's hit film "The
Force Awakens" and is expected to focus on Luke Skywalker (Mark
Hamill), will be in theaters on Dec. 15. The final installment in the current trilogy, "Star Wars:
Episode IX," will be written and directed by J.J. Abrams and
scheduled for release in December 2019. Disney is also making three standalone "Star Wars" films
outside of the Skywalker saga, including last year's "Rogue One"
and next year's "Solo: A Star Wars Story," following the origins
of the charming roguish smuggler Han Solo, made famous by
Harrison Ford in the film franchise.    Reuters
