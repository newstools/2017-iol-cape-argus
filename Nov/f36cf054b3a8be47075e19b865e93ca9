This year this international day was observed under the theme “Waste Water” by 2030, the Sustainable Development Goals aim to reach everyone with sanitation and half the proportion of untreated waste water and increase recycling and safe re-use. In 2013, the UN announced that November 19 each year should be dedicated to stimulate dialogue and draw attention to the global sanitation challenges. The UN also said that by doing this, this would encourage action from governments around the globe to recommit themselves to curb the plight of those without proper sanitation. South Africa has made significant strides in ensuring that the previously disadvantaged communities get proper and dignified sanitation. The provision of decent sanitation means communities no longer have to walk long distances to access sanitation. While we acknowledge progress made, unfortunately vandalism of toilet infrastructure and communal taps remain a significant challenge. Sadly, damaging of the infrastructure meant to help communities undermines gains made by government. As we observed World Toilet Day, we say different players can play an integral role in curbing vandalism by employing the following measures. * Communities must not deposit foreign objects into the toilets. * Business must encourage industries (scrapyards) not to buy stolen toilet infrastructure. * Communities are urged to report incidents of vandalism to the local authorities. * Awareness and education remains a key intervention to curb vandalism and theft. “Water is Life, Sanitation is Dignity.” * Malusi Rayi is the Deputy Director of Communications
