Because if we are silent we become complicit. We need to speak out," he said. Naidoo said: “I hope this campaign scares all potential perpetrators of violence. Victims should not be afraid to speak out anymore. It is important for the families of victims to speak out as well. In some cases families do not believe victims of abuse,” he said.    Makina said it was shocking to see how rife sexual abuse was.  “It is hard to believe the amount of abuse that is happening. In some cases men are watching while it is happening.
