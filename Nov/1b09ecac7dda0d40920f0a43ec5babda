Hermanus Bienas was given the accolade at a ceremony held at the Nederburg Wine Estate in Paarl. The competition is co-sponsored by the Western Cape Department of Agriculture and Shoprite. Bienas, 56, works at Kys Nursery in Vredendal as an assistant manager, and said he wants to improve the lives of people working in the agriculture sector. “This award motivates me to contribute to finding solutions to the difficult economic circumstances facing employees,” Bienas said. Alan Winde, MEC for Economic Opportunities, said: “I am encouraged that Hermanus wants to use this achievement to improve the lives of his fellow employees in agriculture. This is a priority for the Western Cape government. "Past winners share our commitment to ensure this sector allows workers to reach their goals. We want to connect agri professionals to a support network so they can fulfil their potential," Winde said. "Agri workers in particular make such an important contribution to the country’s economy, and they’re the reason we have fresh, quality products for sale in our supermarkets," said Dr Johan van Deventer, general manager at Freshmark (Shoprite’s fruit and vegetable procurement and distribution arm).
