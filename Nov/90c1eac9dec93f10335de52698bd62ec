Cape Town - If you're wondering why there is a giant rainbow of plastic buckets erected in Church Square, wonder no more. Future Cape Town has established the brand initiative to highlight the #WaterCrisis to locals and visitors. A pop up park covered in 500 square metres of artificial grass has been set up near Cape Town's bustling Adderley Street. The temporary installation will be up until May 2018. It forms part of Future Cape Town’s mission to bring attention to the square and encourage locals and tourists to spend time there. There are public performances and art installations planned for the park. There are also deck chairs set out for people to relax in the park and take in the park's centre piece - a "rainbow" of plastic 1 litre buckets. There are 500 of them, representing the target of 500 million litres of collective daily water consumption the City of Cape Town wants residents to cut their usage to. A “Tug of War” sculpture has also been erected by local artist Jaco Sieberhangen which illustrates a push and pull between humans and the delicate balance of water. Future Cape Town is also calling for ideas and projects to raise awarness on the grass circle. You can submit ideas via email to talent@ChurchSquare.CapeTown  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
