Cape Town - Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu will be among seven alumni and public figures UWC will honour at the Chancellor’s Outstanding Alumni Awards. The Awards recognise extraordinary alumni who have made outstanding contributions to their respective fields of study and professions, and towards nation-building in South Africa. UWC Chancellor Archbishop Thabo Makgoba will award five outstanding alumni:
* Professor Alan Christoffels, who is leading pioneering and acclaimed international academic research efforts in bioinformatics and human health as director and holder of the Department of Science & Technology/National Research Foundation SARChI Chair in Bioinformatics and Public Health Genomics;
* Ms Ilhaam Groenewald, chief director of sport at Stellenbosch University (and former director of sports administration at UWC), who in 2016 became the first woman to serve on the executive council of the South African Rugby Union;
* Dr Amir Aman Hagos, who as State Deputy Minister of Health in Ethiopia and in capacity has led numerous health innovations in his home country, building research capacity and empowering health workers;
* Professor Shaheed Hartley, who as director of UWC’s Science Learning Centre for Africa has spearheaded the development of 57 state-of-the-art science labs in disadvantaged South African schools, and has helped promote a better understanding of science in teachers and learners alike; and
* Mr Brent Williams, CEO/managing partner of Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr, the first black legal professional to hold this position in a major South African corporate law firm, who has led the firm in new strategic directions. The Chancellor will also present Special Recognition Awards for outstanding service to UWC:
* Archbishop Emeritus Desmond Tutu, who served as Chancellor of the University from 1987 until 2011, helping UWC chart a course as the intellectual home of the left, while providing moral leadership for the entire nation; and
* Professor Jan Persens, who lectured in mathematics at the University from 1973 until 2003, when he was appointed as director of international relations until his retirement. The UWC Chancellor’s Outstanding Alumni Awards serve to honour some of UWC’s most deserving figures – people who used what they learned at UWC to contribute towards building a better world. “These scholars, professionals and public figures have made immense contributions to the life and standing of the University of the Western Cape and to the wider world, contributions that deserve recognition,” said Archbishop Makgoba. “They are testimony to what UWC holds – if UWC was once a university protesting for a democratic South Africa, it is now a university that can hold its own, against anyone, as an acclaimed institute of higher learning in South Africa. These individuals – as graduates, scholars, professionals and patrons – are all testimony to that.”  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
