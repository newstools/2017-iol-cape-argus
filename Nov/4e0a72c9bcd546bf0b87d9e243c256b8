This is according to child rights group Molo Songololo director Patric Solomons, who said access to support services for children after they were abused was critical. “This will impact whether children report cases of violence and abuse. Because if the cases are not reported, the children cannot get help. More cases in which the perpetrator is unknown to the child are more likely to be reported. Where the perpetrator is known to the child, they are less likely to report it,” he said. Solomons said some rape cases also got reported by schools when teachers reported behavioural changes in children. These children usually also perform badly at school. “Later we discover the child was raped a few months earlier. The rape then led to the behavioural changes.” He added that children who did not receive counselling after being raped or abused were at high risk. They became traumatised and often withdrew. They performed poorly and chances were that they would drop out of school. They were usually between 10 and 17 years old. Solomons said there had been an increase in violence against children, “especially among young children. Even babies are raped”. This is happening far too frequently and has become a huge problem in our communities. Communities have become desensitised and have almost normalised violence against children.  Something substantial needs to be done,” he said. Cape Argus
