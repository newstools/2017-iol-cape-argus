Siyasanga Ntsizi, the festival director, said: “The festival brings together artists and audiences from different backgrounds and cultures to celebrate and preserve our heritage in tourism, arts and culture. “Khayelitsha is the perfect place to experience the local values, buy handmade crafts and taste South African culture.” The festival began on Thursday and concluded on Sunday. Both the opening and closing ceremonies were held at Rands, in Khayelitsha. Ntsizi said there were about 5000 people at the opening event. The various exhibitions and events that form part of the festival were held at various venues around Khayelitsha, including the Lookout Hill Tourism Centre, Makuk-
hanye Art Room, OR Tambo Hall and False Bay College. “We had an overwhelming response from people around Khayelitsha who came to show their support. Many of the events we held required tickets for entry, and people really bought those tickets. We also had walk-ins at the exhibition centres, people coming to see what was happening. “It was a real success and we saw there was a great need for such a festival here,” said Ntsizi. One of the highlights of the festival was the comedy show at the OR Tambo Hall held on Friday. Ntsizi said 250 people attended the show, hosted by Khayelitsha comedians. Another highlight was the Maskandi music show, at the same venue, on
Saturday. “The show was a huge blast. We had nationally recognised artists, and everyone enjoyed it,” said Ntsizi. The Makukhanye Room, a shack in Site B turned into a theatre, also attracted crowds. Local artists performed at the event. “We hit a lot of hurdles in organising the event, but we also learnt a lot in the process. We are proud to say that 50 volunteers from Khayelitsha were hired and got a stipend from working at the festival. “It was a success,” said Ntsizi.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
