Several properties were gutted and vegetation burnt out in the fires, which were fanned by strong winds. Mayco member for safety, security and social services JP Smith said firefighters were still dousing the fire that started near Sir Lowry’s on Tuesday, and  stretched to the seaside. “Authorities are still focusing on two areas of concern following Tuesday’s blaze.They’re focusing on damping down and monitoring areas of concern. In total, 10 private properties were affected by the fire, four vehicles, two factories and two outdoor storage businesses.” Mark Shearer, owner of Mary-Ann’s Emporium & Eatery restaurant, warehouse and music school in Gordon’s Bay, said what broke his heart was seeing two of his staff members breaking down in tears, as they lost more than a job. “Twenty staff members are currently unemployed, two of them were living on the restaurant property and lost everything.The place has been successfully running for 13 years and my staff members helped to make it successful. Other employees have taken in the two who lost everything. We will help them to find new jobs, find a way to rebuild and bring them back.” He said it was freak occurrence as the fire moved past other properties, hopped from his property onto their back fence, shot over to the warehouse. Some of the wood caught alight. A little car that parked there was burnt and a gas bottle exploded. Smith said current estimate of damages in Strand or Gordon’s Bay were R38 million, but they were tallying the cost. In Simon’s Town, fire crews were still trying to get vegetation fires under control. At the Navy, store rooms and other facilities were damaged. Smith said in Atlantis, fire vehicles attended to a fire in Otto du Plessis Drive while in Darling Street, Cape Town a three-storey building had caught fire.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
