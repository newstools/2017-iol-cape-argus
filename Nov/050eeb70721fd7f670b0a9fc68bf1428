The law enforcement then suddenly come up with action plans so as to appease the community. This is a good thing to do. I once saw a movie where a black girl in rural America was raped by two white men and the girlâ€™s father applied immediate justice by shooting both suspects. I want the citizens of South Africa and all departments that deal with law enforcement to do the same. The attorney defending the father in this movie asked everybody in the court room - as I am asking you - to close your eyes and picture what a woman and child go through when a 
barbarian rapes them. Still with closed eyes, imagine that the barbarian then with a instrument or bare hands slaughters them like an animal. Eyes still closed, imagine what effect such a barbaric act has on you, your family, your friends and your community. You are forgiven if you shed tears. Go further and with eyes still closed picture how the perpetrator, if arrested, is dealt with by the Justice Department and then Correctional Services and imagine what justice you would have like to see done. I also want to request that all these officials in the law enforcement, justice and correctional departments imagine the above scenarios. We in South Africa must tell the real story, the real facts, and when one does that, then reality will sink in. Maybe then the criminals will not dare commit crimes against women and children. * Keith Alfred Adolph Blake is a Cape Town resident from Ottery ***The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
