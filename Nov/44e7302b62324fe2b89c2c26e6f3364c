Cape Town - An eight-year-old boy died in an ambulance that was transporting him to hospital after the van was attacked on the N2 in the early hours of Wednesday morning. The Western Cape Government Health Emergency Medical Service ambulance was on its way to the Red Cross Children’s Hospital when it was ambushed on the N2, near Borcherds Quarry. EMS spokesperson Robert Daniels said the van was stoned and came to a standstill before it was attacked. "The crew was held up at gun point and robbed and the ambulance left immobile. Unfortunately, the critically injured eight-year-old patient in the back of the ambulance, a boy with severe head injuries he sustained during a motor vehicle accident earlier (Tuesday) night, died," Daniels said. Daniels said the little boy died at the scene due to the delay caused by another attack. Earlier this year, EMS manager Pumzile Papu said at least 32 ambulances were attacked, since the start of the year and some staff members had to take stress leave as a result of the attacks. Ambulances have needed police escorts to enter some “red zone” areas that have been identified. A total of 15 areas have been identified as red zones including Browns Farm in Philippi, Tafelsig, Hyden Park, Nyanga, Gugulethu and New Crossroads.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
