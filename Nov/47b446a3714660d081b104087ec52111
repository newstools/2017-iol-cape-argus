Desperate parents and community of Hanover Park are trying everything to raise funds for Tasneem Cookson, a Grade 10 pupil at Groenvlei High. The 16-year-old will be able to showcase her skills at Dallas International Girls Cup if she gets R27 500. Her mother, Shireen Wilson, 36, said it would be Tasneem's first time going abroad, and the tournament might open other doors for her. “There is nothing that makes a parent happy and proud like seeing your child’s dream turning into reality. We have started fundraising, we had food sales, music and song extravaganza, next week Saturday we will have karaoke. I really appreciate the community for sharing this story,” said Wilson. She said the tournament would take place in March next year but the money had to be raised by the end of December. Tasneem said her her passion for soccer started when she was nine. “My street was full of boys and there was no girl who was the same age as me. From street soccer I represented Western Province and the SA Football Association on many occasions since then. Currently I play for Ikapa United. "I can’t wait to go and show them what I can do,” said Tasneem. Wilson said people wishing to assist the her child could call e-mail her at shireencookson52@gmail.com  ohkule.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
