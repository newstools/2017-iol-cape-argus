Principal Riyaadh Najaar said the school was very excited about the pool, which would be able to host various events and to facilitate swimming clubs in the area. “The pool is not only for the learners, but also for swimming clubs that have to travel far out to practise,” he said. Najaar said the school was in the process of building a mini pool to teach learners how to swim before the big one was complete. “Though there is no estimate time when the pool will be complete, we will be getting a ‘learn to swim’ pool in the meantime to equip learners for the real thing,” he said. The project will have a direct impact on the unemployment rate in the community as Najaar plans to host training programmes for potential facilitators. He said: “All the labourers involved in the process of building the pool and thereafter are strictly local, and nothing will change that.” Due to the water crisis the school has already placed sustainable boreholes and also have a mini aquifer running under the ground. Najaar said he had approached various organisations for assistance, but had been unsuccessful. “Government officials only find it necessary to cater for the privileged when it comes to aquatic sport codes. What about the underprivileged?” he asked. Ishaq Peters, the senior representative for the school governing body, said: “Mr Najaar has our full support. He is a visionary and should be recognised as such. The plans he has for the pool are but a drop in the ocean compared with what is actually a reflection of his heart towards the school, and people in general.” To help with financial assistance, contact the school at 021 392 9463.
