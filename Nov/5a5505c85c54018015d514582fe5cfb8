Cape Town - It'll be a blue Monday for Cape Town's commuters as delays on Metrorail's lines are expected to continue into the afternoon peak. There are delays of around an hour.    One of the reasons is due to a train fire on the Monte Vista, which saw three carriages destroyed. "Metrorail confirmed that it lost more capacity after a carriage caught fire today shortly after noon," the rail commuter operator said. "A passenger trailer of train number 2862 was reported on fire as the train was drawing into Century City Station. The two adjoining carriages have also been damaged. The fire affected optic fibre cables leading to the nearby train traffic control centre as well. "No injuries have been reported.

"The railway line is currently closed until the flames have  been doused and infrastructure assessed for any fire damage. "It is as yet too early to speculate on the cause of the fire. The extent, cause and cost of the damage will only be confirmed after TFR and PRASA’s loss adjusters have assessed the infrastructure and rolling stock," Metrorail said. A shuttle service is in operation, but commuters travelling to the northern suburbs will have to find their own way from central Cape Town to Monte Vista station.           argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
