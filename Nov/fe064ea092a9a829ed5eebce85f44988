Cape Town - UCT has confirmed it is issuing earplugs to students during examinations. An image of a sealed set of earplugs did the rounds on social media on Wednesday. "At each exam session, provision is made for earplugs for all students who would like to use them. Students who wish to use the earplugs have the option of doing so – this is optional. These are supplied to mitigate any possibility of external noise. However, it must be stated that the noise levels in the venue are not above normal," UCT spokesperson Elijah Moholola said.       A student at the university who spoke to the Cape Argus on condition of anonymity said the earplugs were issued at the temporary exam venues, suituated on UCT's sports fields which are adjacent to a busy highway. "There is no protesting and everything is very calm at the university," he said. UCT circled its temporary examination venues in crowd-control steel fencing, deploying guards in riot gear and a number of canine units, in the event of violent student protests. Newly elected SRC president Karabo Khakhau said she had engaged with management on the issue. "Management's response was that this is just a precaution just in case there are any disruptions," Khakhau said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
