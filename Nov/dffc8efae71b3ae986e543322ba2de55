Her mother Juanita, said she is still in shock and disbelief of what had happened to her child. A family friend Mortimer Saunders has been arrested in connection with her murder. The case is expected to resume on February 5. Juanita Pieters was also recently diagnosed with tuberculosis. She said she misses her baby every day. “It has been really hard for me because I was still breastfeeding her, at the time she disappeared. After work, every evening was our time together. Courtney would come and lay next to me on the bed and I would breastfeed her until she fell asleep. “Losing a child is not easy. The highlight of my day was also when I would bring them party packets home. To see how her eyes light up, was some of the precious moments I will treasure forever. But I will never see her eyes light up again,” she said. Ronald Ruiters, grandfather of the murdered Jeremiah Ruiters, 18 months, said the family was still shocked  over what happened to the toddler. “How can someone rape and kill an 18-month-old innocent child?,” he asked. Ameerudien Peters, in whose care the child was, has since been arrested as has Jeremiah’s mother, Abigail Ruiters. Peters has been charged with murder and rape and Ruiters with child neglect.
