Like other researchers and educationists, I too believe that pupils should be taught politics in schools so that they get a better understanding of the electoral process, key elements of politics, how the government works and it will also broaden their knowledge base of national and international events. They must be able to make an informed choice or decision in an election. Politics and schooling cannot be separated as pupils and teachers live in the real world and are socialised by their surroundings. The types of education children receive need to prepare them to become active citizens and participate effectively and intelligently in their careers, civic matters, nation building and even in politics. Learning and teaching is a process of continuous discovering, understanding and improvement. Communities and societies are not immobile or stationary. We live in a dynamic global village where knowledge, culture and even lifestyles are continuously evolving. Education needs to be driven by teachers who have researched and reflected carefully about what the outcomes should be for all children. A holistic and equal opportunity education system will produce an enlightened, vibrant population. Our attitudes about education can inspire childrenâ€™s attitudes and thus show them how to take charge of their own educational journey and life. * Mohamed Saeed is from Pietermaritzburg ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
