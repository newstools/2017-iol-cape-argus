George's teacher Nadia Charles spent the last five months raising funds for him. She raised R28 100. George's old  passport expired in May. His mother Bampende had applied for a new passport in July and in that same month received an SMS, acknowledging her application. Four weeks later she was informed that the passport was still being printed. Then, weeks later, she received shattering news. She was told  her son could not apply for a travel document and had to apply for a passport despite being told a contrary story by Home Affairs officials. George’s parents are from the Democratic Republic of Congo and now permanently live in South Africa. After the Cape Argus story went out, the deputy minister stepped in and gave Maskini a call to collect her son’s passport in Cape Town. “I was so excited I just broke down and started crying, I am so speechless,” Maskini said. “I am so happy with the entire staff of Home Affairs. They are leaving on Monday and he will be there and his dream is coming true,” she said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
