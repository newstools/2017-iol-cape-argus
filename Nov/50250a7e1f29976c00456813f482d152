Botha won the Coaching Achievement Award - just a month before she celebrates her 76th birthday. Botha’s mantra that "one is never too old to learn" has held her in good stead as she has reached the pinnacle of success in the twilight of her career. She began her career as a coach in the late 1960s and has been the head coach at the University of the Free State since 1990. Botha, who has three children, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren, has nurtured and formed the minds of many young talented athletes. She and Van Niekerk’s paths crossed at the University of the Free State where persistent injury hampered his progress as a world-class athlete.  It was through a spark of genius from Botha that Van Niekerk’s career path took a dramatic turn that would lead her charge to greatness. Botha encouraged Van Niekerk to move away from his preferred 200m sprint event to the 400m due to a persistent hamstring injury. Botha has since been instrumental in Van Niekerk’s unprecedented success which includes double world 400m titles, an Olympic gold medal, and the world record in the one-lap sprint. Van Niekerk is also the only man to have produced sub-10, sub-20, sub-31 and sub-44 performances at 100m, 200m, 300m and 400m respectively. Van Niekerk and Mo Farah were beaten to the Male Athlete of Year award by Qatar high jumper Mutaz Essa Barshim, who, it must be said, has also had a wonderful season. But that does not take away one little bit from Van Niekerk’s wonderful achievements over the last few years. And Tannie Ans has played a huge part. The South African sprinting phenom often speaks of the special bond of mutual respect, trust and affection they share with each other. So it is with that same pride and affection that we join Wayde and the rest of the country in saying: “Congratulations, Tannie Ans. And may you guide Wayde to many more titles.” Cape Argus
