The Stellenbosch University Choir were crowned the World’s Best Amateur Choir by Interkultur global list of choirs, at the World Choir Games, held in Sochi, Russia. The choral artists topped a list of 1 000 talented groups, making history as the first South African choir to top the global list; they currently reach over two million views on YouTube. Spokesperson for the choir Frieda le Roux said they were truly honoured and have been receiving great support. “We still pinch ourselves when we see the list. Interkultur has a very comprehensive ranking system.You have to be consistent and win every competition in order to be at the top. Unfortunately next year we will not participate because our  conductor André van der Merwe  has been elected as a member of their board. However, the choir will still perform at the event,” Le Roux said. The choir will travel to Wales and England in June and July next year. They will participate at the Llangollen Eisteddfod in Wales and also perform in Bath and London. Le Roux said students realise it’s prestigious and this pushes them academically as no one can join the choir if they are struggling academically. “There are standards to be met. All of our students are performing well academically. Winning also boosts team spirit and confidence. We were also happy to find four other choirs from South Africa,” she added. South African choirs dominated the top 30 as the Akustika Chamber Singers, Kearsney College Choir, Stellenberg Girls' Choir and the University of Pretoria Camerata also found themselves on the list. The Stellenbosch University Choir was founded in 1936 under the baton of William Morris. Various conductors then established the ensemble as an influential South African choir. An ensemble of approximately 80-100 voices, it has won international acclaim through performances, concert tours and participation in prestige festivals and competitions. Cape Argus
