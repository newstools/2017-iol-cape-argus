Cape Town - There was extensive damage cause by Wednesday's train derailment at Plumstead Station, in Cape Town. "Metrorail technical teams confirmed extensive track damage after a motorcoach derailed near Plumstead Station," Metrorail said in a statement. "Crews worked until late (Wednesday) night to clear the area in time for (Thursday) morning’s peak hour but were unable to restore the tracks for use as yet. "Alternative arrangements remain in place until further notice: 
* Trains from Simon's Town will terminate at Steurhof Station; commuters heading for Cape Town are encouraged to connect with Cape Flats trains to alleviate pressure on buses during peak:
* Although every effort will be made to arrange buses between Steurhof - Wittebome Stations, commuters are advised to arrange their own transport as precaution; and
* A Train service will operate from Wittebome Station to Cape Town. There would be a waiting time of at least an hour. "The alternative arrangements will extend travelling times by 60+ minutes and students with examination commitments are advised board trains at least two hours before their examinations start. "The Departments of Transport & Public Works and Education have been alerted of expected delays and Metrorail calls on bus and minibus-taxi operators to assist learners to get to examination centres. "Customers are encouraged to listen to radio stations, public address announcements at stations, to consult Metrorail's passenger information channels. Those registered to receive short message alerts via phones are requested to share the information with fellow commuters," Metrorail said. Updates would be available via the service's usual social media and other communication channels. @TheCapeArgus  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
