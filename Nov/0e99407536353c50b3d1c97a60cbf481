Kulsoom Ismail runs the Delft South Development and Safety Association, which houses 11 children who are mostly HIV-positive rape victims. There are also children who were abandoned and are victims of child trafficking. Her small orphanage has been chosen as the recipient of this year’s proceeds from the Hope with Laughter Comedy Show. The show will be organised by Fatima Wise and some of her family, and will feature several local comedians. Ismail is using her disability grant and grants from three of the foster kids to run the place. “This woman is trying to make a difference and is not getting much help. She is in need of bedding and beds. She sent us pictures of how the children sleep, and that touched our hearts,” Wise noted. Wise said they hosted the first show last year and hoped that the event could become an annual thing, helping a different child centre every time. “Last year it was in aid of the Baphumelele Children’s Home
in Khayelitsha and we raised
R27 000. We decided to do it again as it was a great success. Hopefully people will eventually hear what it is about and we can do it regularly.” Wise said they would like to help as many people as possible, and their focus was to help children and orphanages. “One of the children was an eight-month-old baby she found in a bin and is HIV-positive, and has no name or identification.” Wise said the comedy event would be hosted at the Islamia Auditorium in Lansdowne on December 8 and would feature Dalin Oliver, Rob van Vuuren as the headline act, Yaaseen Barnes, Phil de Lange and Lindy Johnson. The cost is R200 a ticket, which includes a hot dog, a cooldrink and a chance to win prizes. tickets and more information, Wise can be reached at 076 048 4389.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
