Eight months after her death, her mom, Sandy, said she was told this by the police. She also put up a brave fight before she was killed. “These were the final moments before my child died. She was only 11 years old.” Arendse said losing a child, especially the way Stacha died, created a pain that would never end. “The pain is still very raw. It all happened so fast. It would have been her prom soon and she was looking forward to it. We even had a dress picked out. “On the day of her disappearance we went to enroll her at the high school she was supposed to attend next year. To think that I will never see her at her matric ball. It was her dream to become a model one day. "But now that dream is no more, because my daughter was suddenly taken away from me,” she said. Early on March28 her world came tumbling down. “I got the call just before 3am. They found my Stacha’s body in the bushes near the Swartklip sports field. But the police warned me not to go to the scene. But later I had to go and  identify her clothing. Nothing in the world can prepare a mother for this. "All her pieces of clothing were spread out on the branches of a tree. I just burst out crying when I saw this! The clothes were found about a metre from where her body was dumped. It is believed that her body was put into a wheelie bin and dumped at the site,” she said. Sandy said her daughter’s death had made people cautious, and that children no longer played in the streets at night any more. “We need more campaigns  such as the ‘Don’t Look Away’ to raise awareness,” she said.
