Our nation is his homeland. His parents have entrusted South Africa with the responsibility of providing this young man with opportunity, encouragement and support that I know only comes with the spirit of ubuntu. I and my fellow Angels at the CAFB wholeheartedly believe in this young man and his sporting ability. He deserves - in fact, our nation deserves - to be represented by Georges at that tournament. Nadia has led a team of hundreds and possibly thousands of people who are all fully committed to making Georges’ dream a reality, and no errors or oversight should come up as a barrier to what such an outstanding display of community spirit has achieved. With the utmost faith that the appropriate powers will see this and understand that an entire community’s hopes and dreams are at stake, I would like to request that said powers will see fit that this young man make it to his flight in time for his first match. With hope and determination and belief in ubuntu. * Prenessa Nalliah is the Founder & CEO of Creative Angels Fashion Benefit ***The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
