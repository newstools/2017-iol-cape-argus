Cape Town - A Wallacedene school has managed to save thousands of litres of water and almost R50 000 thanks to a new water gadget which monitors consumption. Learners at Hector Petersen High School have reduced their daily consumption from a massive 47 000 litres per day to just 9 000. The device, called Dropula, was designed and created by Professor Thinus Booysen from the University of Stellenbosch who explains it is a small electronic device that latches onto the existing municipal meter and feeds water usage information onto a server and an App. “So the device reports into our server every minute which then gives you the visibility of the consumption. So if something happens that is out of the ordinary we immediately know and we send text messages to the school. It is about quickly getting feedback,” Booysen explains. Principal Mike Mavovana says at first he was shocked to see all the messages and it resulted in the school being able to detect leaks and other issues and correcting it as soon as possible. The project was rolled out at six Western Cape schools following a partnership between the university, Cape Talk radio and Shoprite. The installation and associated costs of the Dropula amount to R30 000 per year and Mavovana says in just one month the school has been able to save R50 000 which can now be reinvested. “We are very happy and we have seen a change in how our learners think and behave during the water crisis,” he says. Shoprite CEO, Pieter Engelbrecht, says they now plan to roll out the project at 100 more schools which have recorded the highest water consumption in the province.  monique.duval@inl.co.za   Like us on Facebook   Follow us on Twitter
