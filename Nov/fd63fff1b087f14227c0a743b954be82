Meghan Markle is officially leaving her role on legal drama 'Suits' after becoming engaged to Prince Harry. The 36-year-old actress has portrayed Rachel Zane in the legal drama since it first aired 2011, but it has now been confirmed by USA Network - which broadcasts the programme - that the star will step down from the role after season seven finishes airing in 2018. A statement released by the network reads: "From all of us at USA Network and Universal Cable Productions, we want to send our most heartfelt congratulations to Meghan Markle and Prince Harry on their engagement. "Meghan has been a member of our family for seven years and it has been a joy to work with her. We want to thank her for her undeniable passion and dedication to 'Suits', and we wish her the very best." USA Network's official statement comes a week after Meghan's on-screen body double took to Instagram to post a heartfelt goodbye message to the star. It read: "It's been an absolute pleasure and honor being your 'STAND-IN' for the last 2 seasons. Wishing you all the happiness in the world Bella." Bursic concluded her post with two very telling emojis: a heart and champagne glasses. She also included a congratulatory hashtag: #youdeserveitall. (sic)" Meghan has quit her job as an actress to relocate to the UK permanently and carry out royal duties alongside the 33-year-old royal, whom she is set to wed in May next year after he popped the question earlier this month. The pair - who have been dating for 16 months - made their engagement news public on Monday (27.11.17), and revealed the important question had been asked during a "cosy night" in. Meghan revealed: "It was a cosy night, we were roasting chicken ... and it was an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee."
