Artist SaySay Love’s artwork went on exhibition last week. He said he hoped people would come and see how he expressed his love for water. “I was led by my emotions and I feel that it expresses my soul quite well.” He was “addicted” to water and he loved to deal with it in many ways, he said. “I live in Scarborough and there is a beautiful ocean. It’s there every day and when I walk there I felt like someone was calling me to take pictures of the moment.” Say Say Love said he would donate proceeds from his artwork to the Lalela organisation, in Hout Bay, that teaches vulnerable children art. “I have made my life so far and any money would not make it any better. I am blessed as it is. One day those children might go on to do more meaningful things, maybe they will contribute positively to society.” Project co-ordinator Firdous Hendricks said the organisation provides educational art to at risk youth. “We want to keep them safe and doing things that are positive when they are most at risk. Art teaches them to have a more positive outlook on  their education.” Cape Argus
