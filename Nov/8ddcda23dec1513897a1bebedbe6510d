According to the report, white farmers own almost three-quarters of South Africa’s agricultural land, even after 23 years of government efforts to redistribute land to the black majority. Some 73.3% of agricultural land is now owned by whites, down from 85.1% in 1994, the year South Africa first held democratic elections. Black ownership has increased markedly in some of the country’s most fertile provinces. Black farmers own 74% of the land in KwaZulu-Natal and 52% in Limpopo, City Press reported, citing the report to be released this week. Of course, further progress must be made with agricultural land reform, and a proper land audit must be done and published. If land reform is realised, South Africa could present a more humane, just, peaceful, prosperous and democratic face to the world. Land ownership is a social right so that people can grow their own food. Landlessness causes poverty; hence the majority of black people live in grinding poverty. Surely we cannot expect harmony and proper economic growth when these basic human rights have not been addressed? * Tshepo Diale is from Nkwe Estate ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media.
