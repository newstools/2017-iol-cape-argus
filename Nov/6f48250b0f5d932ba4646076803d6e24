Cape Town - The heavy rains in the Western Cape, especially in the Southern Cape region of the province, have seen two estuaries breach their mouths into the sea. Keeping the river mouths of Touws River and Swartvlei closed to protect biodiversity has been of critical importance until the water levels reached above the mean sea level. Breaching involves breaking open the seasand barrier keeping the mouth closed to allow fresh seawater into the estuary, allowing nutrients to enter and mix with the fresh water of the river or lake. If the fresh water level is too low, it would not be able to push the seawater back out. This is why it's important to ensure the level of fresh water is high enough to allow breaching to occur. Garden Route National Park Manager Paddy Gordon was relieved the breach was as closely aligned to the estuary management as possible. Swartvlei was ranked number 7 in South Africa by independent researchers for its biological diversity. "Managing the system is complex but water measured facilitated the decision made to breach/open both the Swartvlei and Touws River mouths," he said. Both the Swartvlei and Touws River estuaries were breached subsequent to the rainfall. The Swartvlei Estuary system was monitored for 24 hours and rainfall was recorded:
* Farleigh - 48.0mm
* Sedgefield - 63.0mm Water height before the rain was at 1.74 meters above mean sea level. However, it later measured between 1.79m and 1.8m above mean sea level. Elsewhere, the rainfall recorded was: * Touws River - 33.0mm and water level at Ebb & Flow rest camp - 1.99m
* Goudveld (forest) - 54mm
* Diepwalle (Knysna forest) - 50mm
* Knysna (Thesen Island jetty) - 35mm Residents from Sedgefield came out in numbers to witness the breaching of the Swartvei estuary. Channels were reportedly prepared days before and machinery was placed on standby as reported by Jonathan Britton, marine ranger for Wilderness. Scientist Dr. Ian Russel cautioned against opening the mouth too soon as during the open and closed phase there is a unique ecological process that collectively works together to maintain a delicate foodweb. The estuary mouth will generally close naturally during the low rainfall periods as there is a reduction of the inflow of freshwater. The closed phase is a time of "rest and recovery" when some interesting and important ecological processes come into play, he said. Adapted from a press release Cape Argus
