The South African Social Security Agency (Sassa) on Monday said it “wishes to inform” all social grant beneficiaries that payments for next month will be made early. In a statement, Sassa said social grant payments for December will begin on 28 November. “Funds will become available for collection at ATMs and all other payment channels from 28 November 2017. Payment at Sassa pay points will start on 28 November 2017, except for the points in Western Cape, which commence on 1 December 2017,” said the statement. The actual payment dates for pay points are printed on the receipts beneficiaries received with their November payment. Funds will be available for collection at ATMs and stores until 22 December. The last date of payments at Sassa cash pay points will be 15 December. Beneficiaries “Social grant beneficiaries are reminded to keep their Sassa payment cards and PINs safe and not to share them with anyone. They should also take note that the expiry date of their cards has been extended beyond December 2017 and the cards don’t need to be replaced this year. “The minister and deputy minister of social development wishes all social grant beneficiaries and their families a peaceful festive season and a prosperous New Year.” The early pay-out will give beneficiaries a chance to 
rectify any problems they may have before the big days arrive and they are left high and dry. ANA
