Residents live with daily threats to their lives and well-being - abject poverty, rampant substance abuse and brazen gangs are the order of the day. Teen pregnancies are rife. These factors all lead to children dropping out of school, and rob them of an opportunity to realise their dreams and potential. These are the realities hundreds of thousands of people face on the Cape Flats, so it’s no surprise to hear the phrase “what good can come out” of one or another suburb. But, something good can, and does come out. Take Paxton Fielies, for example. The teen from Bishop Lavis overcame the odds to be crowned South Africa’s Idol 2017. She took her natural talent, honed her skill through hard work, had the temerity to rise above her circumstances, and went on to achieve a goal. Paxton captured the imaginations of Cape Town’s residents and won the country’s top singing competition.  She rounds out a clean sweep of talent show wins for Cape Town - AnecNote, an a cappella group from Cape Town won ‘SA’s Got Talent’; and earlier this year, Craig Lucas won ‘The Voice SA’. Craig is also from a gang-ridden, drug-infested neighbourhood in Cape Town - Elsies River - and was raised by a single mom. Their victories should rightly be celebrated and Paxton and Craig serve as beacons of hope to the thousands of young people who are faced by the very challenges they managed to rise above. For now, Paxton, 17, is the winner of ‘SA Idols 2017’, but in the weeks and months and years to come, she will also be a hero to countless young women and men who may once have thought: “What good can come out of my neighbourhood?” We urge those living in similar, seemingly untenable conditions, to take heart from Paxton’s incredible journey, and find in her courage their strength to overcome their circumstances and achieve their dreams. * These are the views of the Cape Argus newspaper and do not necessarily represent the views of Independent Media Cape Argus
