Cape Town - Exactly 22 years ago to the day on Monday, the Two Oceans Aquarium opened its doors to the public. From its humble beginnings, today the aquarium is home to a wide variety of species from around the world. Situated at the V&A Waterfront, it is one of the top tourist attractions in Cape Town. Consisting of seven galleries with massive windows for visitors to be able to witness life under the sea, the aquarium is home to more thanÂ 3 000 living sea animals, including sharks, fish, turtles and penguins. However, at the centre of the aquarium's existence is its role as a key player in raising environmental awareness through its exhibits, conservation, and education programmes. It has gained recognition as a leading environmental education centre in South Africa. It is also globally respected for its excellent standards of animal agriculture and the skill of its staff in collecting and transporting live animals.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
