According to police, Verster, 43, was stabbed to death in his bedroom while fighting intruders who burst into his home.  It was reported his 14-year-old son  heard the intruders in the house and tried to fight them off, and was stabbed in the face. Confirming the incident, police spokesperson Noloyiso Rwexana said Stellenbosch police are on the hunt for two suspects for house robbery and murder. “According to reports in the early hours of this morning (Tuesday) at 3am at Brandwacht Stellenbosch, the victim and his wife were sleeping when two unknown suspects entered and attacked him with a knife. A 43-year-old man died due to  injuries while a 14-year-old was injured and taken to hospital for treatment. No one has been arrested so far.” Winston Monale, managing executive of Absa Wealth Management said, they were saddened by the death of their colleague.  “Pieter, a  wealth management regional manager for Western Cape, joined Absa 11 years ago as a wealth manager before quickly rising to a regional leadership role in Bloemfontein, KwaZulu-Natal and Cape Town. He was a leader, a colleague, a friend who touched and impacted everyone that he had contact with. “This is an extremely difficult time for Pieter’s family, friends and for us.  The police are investigating and we are providing appropriate support to his close colleagues and family,” Monale said. Friends and people who knew Verster spoke highly of him. “We were just marching yesterday  against  the killings of farmers and today we wake up to another senseless murder,’’ said  Margaret Van Schoor, a friend. Last Tuesday, wine farmer Joubert Conradie,43, was shot in Klapmuts, Stellenbosch. He later died in hospital. @okuhle_hlati  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
