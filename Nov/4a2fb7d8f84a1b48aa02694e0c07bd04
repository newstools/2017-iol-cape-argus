The families began the claim process in 1995, and on Thursday mayor Patricia de Lille gave the land back to them. Wilfred Smith said he was 12 years old when his family was removed from the area and moved to Lansdowne, and that he was very happy that he had lived to see the day the land was returned. “We were people of the area. We used to get wood from the mountain, and across the road there is a natural spring, and that is where we got our water from, and we still can today." He said he hoped they could move back to the area in the next three years. “I couldn’t adapt and stay in Lansdowne. My aunts still lived here and I would come and visit on weekends, and it would be very difficult to leave when I had to go home on Sunday.” Smith’s wife, Jeanne, said that before the announcement her husband was so excited he could not sleep. “These are educated people who will be coming here, why do you think they are not suitable to stay here? Why must they try to class people. People should be able to live anywhere, no matter what their level of education is.” Jenny Wilson, who helped the community start the claim, praised them for their “patience and perseverance”. “They were a tight-knit community with a great respect for each other. They were faithful and committed to the church." De Lille said the land was now worth R100 million.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
