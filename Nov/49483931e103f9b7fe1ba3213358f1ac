With this in mind, SANParks has cancelled all staff leave and put warning signage at crime hotspots. Signs have been erected at Signal Hill, Silvermine, Molteno Dam and Rhodes Memorial. They read: “You are now accessing an area which may be exposed to safety and security risks.” SANParks spokesperson Merle 
Collins said they would not be deploying additional personnel to the hotspots. “We have a team dedicated to being dispatched. We advised them not to take any leave, and to help us deal with the influx of tourists,” she said. However, not deploying additional personnel at hiking hotspots could have consequences. A month ago Chris Zoeller and his wife went hiking up Glengarriff in Sea Point with their two children. “It was a Saturday at about 11am, and we decided to go hiking. On the trail we saw a man, but didn’t take any note of him,” Zoeller said. The man then approached them and demanded money. “He pulled out a screwdriver and threatened us. My wife took the children and ran away,” he said, after which a scuffle broke out. “The man stabbed me in the knee, and I started bleeding a lot,” he said, adding that his family was still extremely shaken. “We still feel extremely disturbed. It has affected all of us really badly. It makes me angry because it’s a very easy thing to control,” he said. Collins said that SANParks would be doing everything it could this festive period. “We will be working very closely with authorities. We just want tourists to be very aware of the signage, and to be vigilant at all times,” she said. Wilderness Search and Rescue spokesperson Johan Marais said they were aware of the influx. “We are well prepared and we are ready. We also advise tourists just to be cautious and to always go with someone else, and to not wander off,” he said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
