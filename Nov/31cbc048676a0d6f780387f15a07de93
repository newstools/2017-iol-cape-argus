The terror attempt and the foiling thereof became the cause of the celebration of Guy Fawkes Day, traditionally, by burning effigies of either Fawkes or other authoritarian figures, the lighting of bonfires and the setting off of fireworks. This “celebration” has very little to do with South Africa, and some residents have used Guy Fawkes as an excuse to participate in criminal activities like vandalism and assault. As reported in the Cape Argus on Tuesday, 22 people, including three children, were injured on the night of November 5 as a result of “celebrations”. A family lost their home due to a fire caused by the irresponsible use of fireworks.  The Cape Argus commends what the City of Cape Town has done to regulate and control the use of fireworks on Guy Fawkes night - setting aside designated areas for the safe discharge of fireworks, and enforcing by-laws regulating their safe sale - so it remains up to Capetonians to abide by the laws and regulations set out and use fireworks responsibly. Many of the designated areas set out by the City had to be closed down due to the strong winds which increased the risk of fires. Despite this, Capetonians seem to insist on getting their kicks and set off fireworks long after November 5 had passed. There are regular complaints from all circles regarding the discharge of fireworks - animal welfare organisations appeal for people to consider pets, for example - but a ban on fireworks would be impractical and insensitive to those who use fireworks for religious or cultural reasons. If you must set off fireworks, this newspaper appeals to all to do so in a controlled, responsible and considerate manner, and not use the guise of Guy Fawkes as a blanket excuse for outright hooliganism.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus * The views reflected are not the views of Independent Media
