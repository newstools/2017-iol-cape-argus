However, the household income of farmworkers is slowly growing. Just more than 45% of farmworkers have a total income of between R2500 and R4999 while expenditure for the largest group is between R1800 and R2499. The Western Cape Department of Agriculture on Thursday released its Agri Worker Household Census - a study that was undertaken following the violent labour unrest in farming communities who demanded better salaries and conditions on farms. Economic Opportunities and Agriculture MEC Alan Winde said: “After the strikes in agriculture in 2012 (and 2013), we put a plan in place to identify the biggest challenges facing employees in the sector. We collected this data so that we could develop an action plan to resolve these issues. “Through this survey, we’re able to understand the plights and challenges facing our farming communities, right down to household level. We can now also take a broader view to assess trends in specific districts.” A total of 2991 farms participated in the study, 11028 households were surveyed and 42982 residents were covered. Statistics show that farmworkers and their children are largely dependent on state social grants. Figures show 5173 households receive social grants for one or more child. This was  46.9% of all households captured in the census. There are 1082 pensioners who receive a state grant. Overall, 6333 of the 11028 households captured in the census receive one or more social grant. Across the region, 281 households indicated that they were eligible for an old age state grant, but were not receiving it. The report also indicated that 1151 households are eligible for a child support state grant but were not receiving it. Education levels remain a challenge for farmworkers as most of them perform general worker duties and  few have formal education. Figures indicate that 8.5% of farmworkers have a matric and less than 1% have been exposed to tertiary education. It is estimated that the agriculture job market will increase by 34.2% while 12.6% of the labour force will be leaving the market. Most youths are employed in the general worker services and about 5% are employed as tractor drivers. Less than 1% are employed in technical operations, or as irrigation specialists. Not a single youth is employed as a manager. Managerial posts account for 0.4% of all agri-worker positions. Supervisory positions account for 2.9% of agri-worker posts. Antonia Xaba, chief director for rural development, said 78% of workers live on the farms on which they work. Of these, 91% are living in formal housing (bricks and mortar) and 2.3% live in informal dwellings (shacks). Farmworkers’ access to basic services have also improved. Xaba said 79.3% of farmworkers have access to piped water in their homes. She said 97% have access to electricity and 89.85% have flushing toilets. Since 2014, 4724 farmworkers were given training in, among other fields, occupational health and safety, chemical handling and labour law. @JasonFelix  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
