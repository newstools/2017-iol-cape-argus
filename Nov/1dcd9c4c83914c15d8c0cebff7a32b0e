The proposed law allows for adopting parents, including same-sex couples, to get 10 weeks off from work as opposed to taking family responsibility leave or annual leave. The Labour Laws Amendment Bill 2015, on parental leave, will mean that employers will be forced to treat maternity and paternity leave exactly the same for adoptive parents. Before adoptive parents could only take family responsibility leave, which was three days. Labour lawyer Michael Bagraim said the bill applied to parents adopting children under the age of two. He said that before, the labour laws did not recognise adopting parents’ and same-sex-marriage rights. “One of the adoptive parents may apply for adoption leave and the other adoptive parent may apply for parental leave of ten days.” The founder and director of the Wandisa Child Protection & Adoption Agency, Debbie Wybrow, said this was great news for adopting parents. “For optimal outcomes, both parents should be part of that transitioning process. I love the idea of both parents having time to spend together, to be able to devote their full attention to settling their little ones into their new daily routines,” she said. Wybrow said many adopted children have experienced serious trauma. “Neglect and deprivation leave permanent scars, and it is only by establishing and strengthening bonds in a safe environment that adopted children can become healthy, functioning adults,” she said. Triangle Project’s Matthew Clayton said there were still issues with the bill. “It still does not create equality for all new parents. While it is a positive step that fathers will now be able to claim paternity leave under the new bill, we would argue that the distinction between who is the primary or secondary caregiver is one that different parents should make for themselves and that this duty should not automatically fall to a pregnant mother,” said Clayton.  zodidi.dano@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
