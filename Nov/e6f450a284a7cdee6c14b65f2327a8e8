JP Smith, mayoral committee member for safety and security, said that the plan also outlines the roles and responsibilities of a number of other City departments that play a crucial role in ensuring that the festive season runs smoothly in terms of service delivery. “As usual, the City has invested much thought into its festive season plan to ensure that we are ready for any eventuality. This year, we have also had to consider contingency plans to accommodate the drought crisis and its impact on our normal operations. We’re only opening one-third of all swimming pools, so we’ve increased the number of beach lifeguards in anticipation of an increase in the number of visitors.” Earlier this year, the City and Western Cape Transport Department launched a random breath-testing initiative. It seeks to increase the frequency of interaction between motorists and traffic officers with the specific aim of checking for driver sobriety and covering as many areas as possible during a shift. According to Smith, since the launch of the random breath- testing initiative in June, there have been 79 roadblocks, with 22 170 vehicles stopped and 20 397 motorists screened. Cape Argus
