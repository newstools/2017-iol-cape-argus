London - It is a revelation that may embarrass her grandchildren. But Anne Robinson has said she wants people to know she enjoys sex and does not find that it has got "less interesting" as she has got older. The 73-year-old said she has "always enjoyed" that side of life but hinted that her busy work schedule means she sometimes struggles to find the time. The TV presenter was speaking in response Dame Judi Dench’s comments in September in which the 82-year-old said she "still feels desire". Robsinson told the Radio Times: "It’s great. I’ve always enjoyed it and I’ve never felt that getting older has made it less interesting." The twice-divorced presenter has been open about her desire to find a partner and joined the popular dating app Tinder in August – though she quit soon after, finding it "desperate". Asked whether she felt lonely, she said: "Yes. Not as lonely as I’ve been in marriage but I don’t think living on your own is a natural state. The trouble is that I’m not lonely enough to settle for a second-rate partner." She added that any potential suitor would need to be "single, solvent, serious and funny". The so-called Queen of Mean, who was given the nickname for her stern on-screen demeanour, is about to bring back the much-loved quiz show for a celebrity special. However, she said there is a pressure to remain "thin" that comes with doing TV work and that she is on a "permanent diet". On the topic of work done on her face, which she said "was 14 years ago", the grandmother-of-two admitted to having "a bit of Botox – not a lot" over the years. Daily Mail
