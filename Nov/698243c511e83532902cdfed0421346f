The fleet came in with Spanish team Mapfre leading the pack. Along with the excitement of the race, the Bluewater group joined forces with the City, Volvo Ocean Race and the V&A Waterfront to help Cape Town save 500 000 single-use plastic bottles from being used, thanks to new technology they will provide. Anders Jacobson, chief executive 
of Blue AB, the company that owns Bluewater, said they stepped in to help after hearing about the city’s water shortage. “Our partnership provides us with an incredible opportunity to highlight Bluewater’s mission to provide clean drinking water to people everywhere and how our technology can make it more available for millions of consumers around the world.” Volvo Ocean Race Sustainability Programme manager Meegan Jones, said they will offer innovative water refill points at the race village “which means we won’t impact on the City of Cape Town water reserves, while still meeting our plastic reduction goals”.  yolisa.tswanya@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
