“We have always produced artists, prophetic voices, pioneers, visionaries and independent thinkers who have been at the forefront of articulating the aspirations and hopes for a united and free society. "While just being in Khayelitsha is an experience on its own, there are many activities that tourists and local people engage in, from a visit to the colourful and dynamic arts and craft markets (showcasing the best the community has to offer), township tours that include visits to all the main attractions in Khayelitsha to the restaurants that offer a taste of traditional township cuisine, and will ensure you experience the finest dining available,” said festival director Siyasanga Ntsizi. Khayelitsha is the perfect place to experience the local values, buy handmade crafts and taste the South African culture. The festival will bring together artists and audiences from different backgrounds and cultures to celebrate and preserve our heritage in tourism, arts and culture. The event, which runs from November 16 to 19, will take place in various venues around Khayelitsha including the Look-Out Hill Tourism Centre, False Bay College, Chris Hani Arts School, Makukhanye Art Room and many more. The festival programme comprises visual art exhibitions, performing arts, drama, sports, comedy shows, live music, street and dance theatre, lectures, craft fair and workshops.
