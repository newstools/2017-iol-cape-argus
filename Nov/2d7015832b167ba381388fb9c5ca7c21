Cape Town - The police have welcomed the sentence handed down on Riedewaan Salie in the Western Cape High Court. Salie had been convicted of killing Hope Pockpas, 6, and Dillon McKenna, 24, in Lentegeur. The first murder was committed in 2013. Salie killed McKenna in 2016. He was given a 20 year jail term on Thursday. "Although the twenty year prison sentence will not bring his victims back, we are pleased with the incarceration of Riedewaan Salie, 34, today in the Cape High court," police spokesperson André Traut said. "Salie was handed down the lengthy prison sentence for killing six-year-old Hope Pockpas in 2013 and 24-year-old Dillon McKenna in 2016, both in Lentegeur, and for being in possession of an unlicensed firearm during 2016 in Mitchells Plain. "The investigating officer, Detective Constable Morne Sass presented the court with thoroughly investigated case dockets which secured the accused’s conviction, indicating our commitment to send ruthless criminals to where they belong," Traut said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
