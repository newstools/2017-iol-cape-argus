The start of November is also “Movember”, when men are challenged to shave their facial hair  to show their support for male cancer awareness. Sixteen officers and two firefighters came together at the Gallows Hill Traffic Centre  to shave their moustaches and headsand called themselves “Bros”. They  are required to have a clean shave on November 1, and then grow a moustache throughout the month as a sign of their support for the campaign. Firefighter Timothy Hart from Hout Bay Fire Station, and a former testicular cancer sufferer, came to cut off his moustache. Hart, 32,  was diagnosed with stage one cancer and now is helping others to keep a positive outlook if they are faced with a similar diagnosis. Hart said he experienced extreme pain after he completed the Argus Cycle Tour three years ago. He had a  weird sensation in his nipples and his one testicle took on an abnormal shape. “It took me three weeks to pluck up the courage to see my doctor, and some few days after the consultation, to open up to my wife. “I went for an operation to remove the tumour and I opted to wait to see if the cancer was gone before starting with chemo. "Unfortunately, two months later, the check-up revealed that the cancer had spread to my lymph glands and abdomen, so I underwent 21 sessions of chemotherapy," Hart said. Cape Argus
