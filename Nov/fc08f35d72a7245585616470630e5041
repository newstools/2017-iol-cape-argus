New York - US President Donald Trump's
@realdonaldtrump Twitter account was "inadvertently deactivated"
due to human error by a Twitter Inc employee on
Thursday and was down for 11 minutes before it was restored, the
social media company said. "We have learned that this was done by a Twitter
customer-support employee who did this on the employee's last
day. We are conducting a full internal review," Twitter said in
a tweet. "We are continuing to investigate and are taking steps to
prevent this from happening again," the company said in an
earlier tweet.    A Twitter representative declined to comment further. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for
comment.    Trump has made extensive use of messages on Twitter to
attack his opponents and promote his policies both during the
2016 presidential campaign and since taking office in January.
He has 41.7 million followers on Twitter. "Great Tax Cut rollout today. The lobbyists are storming
Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what
is right for America!" he wrote in his first tweet after
Thursday's outage. In a similar incident last November, Twitter Chief Executive
Jack Dorsey's account was briefly suspended as a result of what
he said was an internal mistake. Reuters
