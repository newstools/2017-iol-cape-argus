“We have a responsibility to promote our country externally and to solve whatever problems we have internally in a patriotic and responsible manner,” Zuma said in his televised annual address to Parliament’s National Council of Provinces (NCOP) yesterday. “Attacking South Africa and bad-mouthing the country when she is most vulnerable is irresponsible, especially if done by South Africans themselves.” The president went on to list free services provided by government to the poor, including social grants, free and subsidised housing and health care, free basic education for poor children and free municipal services, as being among the government’s achievements. Poverty, said Zuma, was a result of the difficult economic climate and the legacy of apartheid “which has created a huge gap between the rich and the poor”. “We know that many among the privileged classes become angry when we speak about the reality of the apartheid legacy as they want it to be forgotten. "We will continue to work hard to reverse the horrible impact of this legacy,” he said. ANA
