The City is doing everything possible to deliver additional water as quickly as possible. This water will come online 
incrementally from modular desalination 
plants, groundwater abstraction and water 
reuse. These plans will be at different locations across the city. City experts and staff are on the ground, working long hours to bring new solutions to deliver, while Capetonians save. It is true that a large scale plant, for 
example that produces 300 to 400 million 
litres a day, will be a multi-year project. But the City is not building a large-scale desalination plant at this time. Our plans give the City the agility to respond  quickly and adapt to the drought. Several small-scale desalination plants at multiple locations will inject water into existing infrastructure within the constraints of that infrastructure. These will come online in a matter of 
months. The City is continuously engaging with sector experts, academics and civil society through our Section 80 committee. Our teams are working around the clock to ensure water resilience. Together, in partnership with the people of Cape Town continuing to save, we will not run out of water. * Patricia de Lille is the mayor of Cape Town ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Media Cape Argus
