This after the City gave the go-ahead for the event, despite the objections of the organisation. “We opposed the City’s approval of the event at this time and in this area. Unfortunately, the City decided to approve the event. All we can do is decline to support the event and ask our community to do the same,” said Paige Nick, from the association. The annual event, where joggers will be “bombed” with coloured powder, drew the ire of the association because of the water that will be used to wash off the powder in a time of drought. Event co-ordinator Craig McLennan denied claims the event would exacerbate water scarcity. McLennan said they had put measures in place to carefully accommodate the water crisis. “We have brought in water sachets for the runners from Johannesburg. Vendors have been limited in numbers and also instructed to limit their water usage, but 2 000 litres of non-potable water have been purchased from the Cape Winelands Municipal District to be used for spot cleaning where required. However, we anticipate a completely dry clean-up." He said the runners would donate their dirty T-shirts (there will be specially designated collection containers on the day).Their team members will take them back to Johannesburg to be washed and donated to a worthy charity. “All toilets at the venue will be locked and we have provided more than enough portable toilets for runners to use. This saves all those litres wasted in flushing. We also embarked on an intensive social media campaign educating Color Runners on exactly how to get cleaned up without using more water than they would for their daily hygiene needs,” McLennan added.  okuhle.hlati@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
