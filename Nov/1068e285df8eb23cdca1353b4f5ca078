The party has decided not comment on the two matters that involve De Lille. The topic was discussed at the weekend, but James Selfe, chairperson of the federal executive, said the matters of DA meetings were private. The Cape Argus reported last week on De Lille's belief that she is under political pressure from various quarters and that there are plans to remove her for implementing a spatial transformation plan in the City. This was contained in the affidavit of Craig Kesson, chief resilience officer in De Lille’s office, tabled before the City’s full council. He alleged that De Lille and city manager Achmat Ebrahim covered up corruption involving Melissa Whitehead, transport commissioner of Cape Town. The corruption included an amount of R43 million, Kesson claimed. Ebrahim responded in a letter dated December 2, 2016, that the matter had been resolved. De Lille said the allegations were a malicious attempt to attack her as a whistleblower. In September, tensions surfaced between De Lille and mayoral committee member for safety, security and social services JP Smith. It emerged that De Lille had ordered the closing of the City’s special investigations unit (SIU). Smith oversees the unit, which now has a new mandate. Claims relating to the unit and against De Lille had been contained in a submission, dated August 20, which Smith made. In it, Smith said claims and rumours from others had been heard - the claims included that some councillors may have been involved in a murder and that building done at De Lille's home may not have been legal. In October, the DA placed both De Lille and Smith on special leave from party activities in the Cape metropole because of the spat.  jason.felix@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
