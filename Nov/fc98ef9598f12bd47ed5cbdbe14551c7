The City's Fire and Rescue Service's spokesperson Theo Layne said no injuries were reported. "The City's Fire and Rescue Service responded to Century City railway station at about 12.15, where we've got three railway carriages alight. No injuries have been reported and the cause of the fire is undetermined at this stage," he said. Earlier on Monday, rail services on the Central and Southern Lines were delayed for at least an hour each due to cable theft over the weekend. Cabling was stolen and equipment damaged at Philippi and Khayelitsha. This comes a week after cabling was stolen at Mutual, Woodstock and Woltemade stations, which also severely affected the service on the Central Line. "Metrorail already operates at reduced capacity due to old rolling stock and obsolete infrastructure â€“ any additional incidents of vandalism has the real probability of bringing the system to its knees," regional manager Richard Walker said. "Despite daily occurrences of cable theft and/or vandalism and more than twenty arrests since July this year, no significant shift in crime patterns have been detected," he said. As a result of the train fire, the surrounding vegetation also caught alight, Layne said.  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
