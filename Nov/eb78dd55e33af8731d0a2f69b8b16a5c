The MyCiTi bus service is known as one of the country’s most successful transport systems. Since its inception in May 2010, the bus service has provided residents safe, reliable and affordable public transport. Over the past seven years the City has also invested in broadband infrastructure to stimulate new economic opportunities for residents. “We are beginning to see the return on this investment with the expansion of a call centre on the Voortrekker Road corridor that will add 1000 jobs to our local economy. The new phase of the Capita Call Centre is located adjacent to one of our MyCiTi bus stops in Maitland, meaning those employed at the call centre can use our MyCiTi service to travel to and from work,” said Brett Herron, the mayoral committee member for transport and urban development. The City is using public transport to achieve a more compact, efficient and sustainable city. Cape Town’s major public transport corridors form the backbone of what are called integration zones. The Voortrekker Road corridor is one of these integration zones (IZs). “By prioritising dense, transit-oriented growth and development in these IZs, the City seeks to create more inclusive communities with access to improved services, job opportunities, and affordable housing and public transport. The opening of the second phase of the Capita Call Centre in Maitland is a shining example of what we are pursuing. The new phase adds 1000 new jobs to the existing 700 employees already based at the centre,” Herron said. “The call centre depends on affordable, reliable transport for its employees. We want to increase similar employment nodes across the city,” Herron said.  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
