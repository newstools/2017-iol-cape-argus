Cape Town - A group of young South African future leaders will soon be jetting off to Japan for the Ship for World Youth Programme. The Ship for World Youth program is organised and implemented by the Management and Coordination Agency of the Japanese Government in conjunction with the Cabinet Office. The program serves as a unique cross-cultural exchange program that aims to provide participating youth with the opportunity to enhance their leadership and management skills necessary to excel in an increasingly globalised world. "By engaging in a series of expert-led seminars, and participant-led workshops and cultural activities, participants are challenged to deepen their mutual understanding, broaden global perspectives, and strengthen their spirit of international cooperation," said Dr Firdous Khan from the Human Sciences Research Council.   "Overall, the Ship for World Youth Leaders program aims to harness future leaders capable of contributing to society by exercising their leadership skills in various fields in global society while establishing a strong human network beyond borders. "Each year a number of countries are invited to participate in the program. This year South Africa was invited and 12 candidates were selected from around the country to represent our country and LEAD SA on a global stage. As South African Participants we are expected to introduce the rest of the world to the dynamic culture, tradition and beauty that is South Africa. "Most countries participating in the program have an active government support and thus are able to source the relevant sponsorships required to make the program successful for their delegation," she said. But the South African delegation is looking for support in securing sponsorship for the following items: * Team uniform/ kit
* Team cultural outfits like traditional attire for both male and female bead work
* Shipping costs from SA to Japan to host an SA Delegation Party for participating youth from other countries.
* Five official gifts for the governments of all the countries and Japanese prefecture that will be hosting the SA delegation on the program
* South African Souvenirs Anyone who is able to assist is requested to contact Dr Khan atÂ fkhan@hsrc.ac.za  argusnews@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
