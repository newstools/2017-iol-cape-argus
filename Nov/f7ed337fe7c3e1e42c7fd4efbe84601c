Mayoral committee member for safety and security; and social services JP Smith said 100 more lifeguards would be deployed - the most ever deployed. The NSRI has also sharpened its readiness and recently launched a campaign which aims to prevent fatal drownings. “We have put together a few plans to assist people in drowning situations,” NSRI national drowning prevention manager Andrew Ingram said. The institute has launched an emergency floatation campaign using Pink Torpedo buoys. These brightly-coloured rescue devices, chosen because they are highly visible, are being placed in high-risk areas. “The idea behind the project is to get emergency flotation to someone who is in danger of drowning as fast as possible, while calling for professional help. Graphics on the sign advise that the buoy should be thrown to someone in distress, that an untrained rescuer should not get into the water to try to rescue someone, and provides two telephone numbers to dial for help.” Ingram said. Each Pink Torpedo buoy sign has a location number so that bystanders can immediately inform the sea rescue volunteers exactly where they are. One hundred Pink Torpedo buoys have been sponsored and are being deployed at Plettenberg Bay, Wilderness, Jeffreys Bay and Melkbosstrand. Ingram also advised the public to be extra cautious on the beach: “It’s important for the public to go to the beaches where there are visible lifeguards. “Every year we look at the areas in which we are weak and last year we saw we were specifically weak in the lifeguard area. We have decided to up our game, which means more lifeguards will be deployed. “We are pleading with the public to avoid alcohol on the beaches we also advise parents to please take care of their children."  marvin.charles@inl.co.za  Cape Argus
